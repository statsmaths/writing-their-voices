    <p>ENRIQUE AND AMANDA </p>
    <p>Amanda's house is several "blocks east of the Hav-A-Tampa cigar factory, on a narrow dirt alley lined with unpainted </p>
    <p>frame shacks. A group of children playing marbles in the sand includes blondes, dark Latins, and Negroes. They </p>
    <p>scatter like a flock of chickens when they see the car approaching. </p>
    <p>As soon as the car stops they gather around it, climb upon front and rear bumpers and the running boards. Dark, stout, </p>
    <p>and smiling, Amanda shouts to the children and comes out to greet us. She hugs my wife Edith, and shakes my hand. </p>
    <p>"I been wanting to meet your husband a long time," she tells Edith. </p>
    <p>We enter the front room and sit in three rickety straight chairs. The only other furnishings are a table, a new </p>
    <p>automatic-tuning radio, and two calendars. Several children stand in the doorway, staring, and a small boy bobs his </p>
    <p>blonde head in and out of another door leading to a bedroom. </p>
    <p>"Them's all my kids," Amanda says, "and they sure look like tramps. There is no use for me to wash them in the </p>
    <p>afternoon when the come home from school because by night they have got all dirty again. I just leave them alone till </p>
    <p>night and wash them good before they go to bed. </p>
    <p>1220 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>2. </p>
    <p>"They "been playing marbles with those colored kids next door. Those colored kids are nice children; their mother, she </p>
    <p>is a good woman from Georgia. I rather have my hoys play with them than with a lot of other kids in this </p>
    <p>neighborhood. </p>
    <p>"Did you notice the people sitting on the porch of the second house down from here? They are not such good people. </p>
    <p>He is all right, but his wife Is not so good. Una Libert iny. She has three men giving her money-she calls them 'old </p>
    <p>"buzzard1 unless they bring her money. </p>
    <p>"Besides these four kids here I got two raore girls living with my cousin in Key West. She can take better care of them </p>
    <p>there; she ainft got no kids of her own. That blonde-headed rascal that keeps poking his head around the door is named </p>
    <p>Jose^\ he's five years old, and the other boy, Perico, is eight. Maria is nine, and Rosa-she's my oldest-is thirteen.M </p>
    <p>Rosa says, "How do you do?" She has brown hair, a delicately pretty face, and intelligent brown eyes. She does not </p>
    <p>have on any rou^e or lip -stick, and her cheap house-dress is torn in many places. </p>
    <p>"You know what?" asks Amanda. "Rosa, 13 years old, is getting ready to get married. I wish I knew how to knock </p>
    <p>that idea out of her head." </p>
    <p>"The sooner I get married and get away from here, the better," smiles Rosa. </p>
    <p>"He's an Italian," says Amanda, "and I don't want no Italian son-in-law in the family." </p>
    <p>"Well, you might as well get used to it," says Rosa. "I love Nicky and I'm going to marry him no matter what anybody </p>
    <p>says. He's a very nice </p>
    <p>Italian. He has a mustache, dark hair, and he's tall." </p>
    <p>1221 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>3- </p>
    <p>"He's got blue eyes," adds Amanda. </p>
    <p>"He has not!" declares Rosa. "His eyes are very li^ht brown. I ought to know-I've been close to hiia.'" </p>
    <p>"I don't see why you can't marry a Cuban or an American-anything but an Italian," says Amanda. </p>
    <p>"I do like Americans," admits Bosa. "Sure.' But I can't do nothing about it. The only way to get Americans is to be </p>
    <p>high-toned and lire in Hyde Park and I can't do that. I don't want any damn wild crackers from out in the woods, </p>
    <p>either. They're wild people. You can grow potatoes in their ears and scrape their heels. </p>
    <p>"Nicky is a beautician in New York and he came down here to visit his family for the holidays. He has stayed so long </p>
    <p>he has lost his job, and now he wants to go back to New York and get a job in a restaurant. He wants to go back and </p>
    <p>get a job and then come marry me, but I want him to marry me first and take me with him when he goes. I always </p>
    <p>wanted to live in New York." </p>
    <p>"She's only known him for three weeks," says Amanda, "and says she is going to marry him. Well, marriage is like a </p>
    <p>lottery: you don't know whether you win or lose till it's all over. </p>
    <p>"I was married when I was 13 years old, just like Eosa. That's how I know she's too young to think about getting </p>
    <p>married. She ought to be in school." </p>
    <p>"That's right," asserts Edith. </p>
    <p>"You think I want to start back to school now?" demands Hosa. "And go back to the seventh grade where my kid </p>
    <p>brother is now? Hell no! </p>
    <p>VZ'ZZ </p>
    <p/>
    <p>I wouldn't start hack now for nothing! " </p>
    <p>"Eosa sure was smart in school, too," says Amanda. "She made all A's from top to bottom, and even skipped a grade. </p>
    <p>She quit school he-cause she had fainting spells and the doctor said she had a weak heart. But now she goes to dances </p>
    <p>and everything and doesn't ever faint no more so I think she must he all right and ought to go back to school. </p>
    <p>"I used to have fainting spells like Eosa before I was married, but since I been married I aint had any at all. Me, dark </p>
    <p>like I am, would get white as a sheet when X fainted. Z don't know what that is-I never went to a doctor for it." </p>
    <p>"I've got a job in a sewing room," says Eosa. "Not the WPA; a Jew-store sewing room. I made $2.20 last week, but </p>
    <p>you know I am only an apprentice learning my trade; I will make more money soon. There is a supervisor there </p>
    <p>watching us all the time to see that we don't rest. Sometimes when he is in some other part of the shop we stop a </p>
    <p>minute, but when we see him coming we have to start working quick or he docks part of our pay. The only way I can </p>
    <p>get any rest is to go to the lavatory. We aren't allowed to stay there but a few minutes." </p>
    <p>Little Joscrt) suddenly dashes into the room with a rubber ball and flings himself on Amanda's lap. He is pursued by a </p>
    <p>small, thin, bow-legged girl who tearfully accuses him, in Spanish, of stealing her ball. Amanda forcefully takes the </p>
    <p>ball, and returns it to the girl. Jose*' wails strangely. </p>
    <p>"Jose's deaf and dumb," Amanda explains. "He stole that girl's ball and now he wants to go take it away from her </p>
    <p>again. He's some tough roughneck. He fights anybody; he don't care how big they are." </p>
    <p>1223 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>5. </p>
    <p>"I rather he dead, than deaf and dumb like that," solemnly declares Maria. </p>
    <p>Perico walks cautiously across the room, and turns on the radio. "I hope it isn't church music,w he says. </p>
    <p>"Here comes my husband, Enrique, now," exclaims Amanda, "he's been to the store." Enrique seems to be about Ho </p>
    <p>years old; he has a rather handsome face, and appears to be quite active and virile. </p>
    <p>"I don't spoil my children," continues Amanda. "When I go to visit somebody my children come along and sit down </p>
    <p>and behave themselves and don't run around hollering. They don't always ask for bread when I go visiting, either, like </p>
    <p>a lot of kids do. </p>
    <p>"Jose eats candy all day. It's bad for his teeth and I ought not give it to him but he cries if I don't. He111 take all the </p>
    <p>pennies you will give him, but he won't take no nickels or dimes or nothing like that. * guess maybe he never spent </p>
    <p>nothing but pennies in his whole life; he must think pennies is the only thing you can buy stuff with. </p>
    <p>"He sure hates to take a bath. Sometimes when he knows he's going to have to take a bath he gets on the toilet and sits </p>
    <p>there for hours, just to keep from having to take a bath. You try to take him off the toilet and he hollers and hollers. </p>
    <p>The only way you can make him take a bath is to get a belt and make out like you are going to whip him. Then he will </p>
    <p>get in the tub." </p>
    <p>"My kids know when I take off my belt I mean business," says Bnrique, speaking for the first time. "They know I treat </p>
    <p>them good and buy them things and don't buy myself nothing. I buy my wife a dress and the kids </p>
    <p>$2 suits for Christmas and me no buy nothing." </p>
    <p>1224 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>6. </p>
    <p>"Jose sure is stubborn, " Amanda goes on, "and what a temper he's got! When he wants something and can't make you </p>
    <p>understand what it is, he sure makes a fuss. I want to send him to school as soon as I can. He has a good head on him. </p>
    <p>He can learn to write and will get along fine, I think. I took him to the doctors here and they said he was horn that way </p>
    <p>and there wasn't nothing they could do. </p>
    <p>"Jose goes to shows and likes them very much. You should see the motions he goes through when he comes home and </p>
    <p>tries to tell me what he saw. He imitates automobiles, airplanes, horses, everything. You should see him imitate </p>
    <p>Enrique shaving and brushing his teeth. </p>
    <p>Jose is sitting on the cement steps, exploding caps with a small tack hammer. He watches the caps very carefully so he </p>
    <p>can see the smoke and tell when they explode. He explodes the last cap, looks around for approval, and puts the head </p>
    <p>of the hammer in his mouth and chews on it. </p>
    <p>"He is always chewing on some kind of iron," Amanda complains, "always chewing on his belt buckle or something </p>
    <p>like that. Look how he's got his belt fastened up now-with a match-stick. He chews off his belt buckles faster than I </p>
    <p>can sew them on. </p>
    <p>"You'll have to forgive our humble house," says Amanda apologetically. "I only pay S3 a week for it, but it is near </p>
    <p>Enrique's job. Did you know they're planning to tear down a lot of these old 'shotgun' shacks T -You know, these old </p>
    <p>houses are called one- or two-barrelled shotgun shacks, according to how many apartments they have. I heard they are </p>
    <p>going to build big new apartments for Negroes, and make them all move into one section and not be scattered all over </p>
    <p>like they are now. I don't know as all of them will want to move, but I guess the city will condemn </p>
    <p>their property if they don't. </p>
    <p>1225 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>7. </p>
    <p>"Enrique made all this furniture out of boxes and things; he made those benches and that table and that cabinet and </p>
    <p>icebox. He made the ice box out of tin; it keeps ice good, too. Enrique is good like that; he saves us a lot of money. He </p>
    <p>makes wicks out of old carpet for the oil stove, and he makes vinegar and wine with raisins. </p>
    <p>"You know, I would like to have nice furniture, but I donft like to go in debt. I don't believe in buying furniture unless </p>
    <p>you can pay for it. The only thing we owe money on is that radio; it cost $39-50 and it sure is a good one. It gets all </p>
    <p>the Cuban stations. </p>
    <p>"Some people go ahead and buy pretty things and go in debt when they can't afford it and maybe the company takes it </p>
    <p>away from them and then they lose all that money. There's nothing I hate worse than to have collector men coming to </p>
    <p>my house all the time bothering the life out of me and keeping me broke. I rather buy good healthy food for my kids </p>
    <p>and a few little clothes for them to go to school; it don't make so much difference about the furniture. I think it's best </p>
    <p>to save and keep a little money ahead in case there is sickness or anything like that. It don't look like we are able to get </p>
    <p>much ahead, though. </p>
    <p>"When Enrique is working steady he likes to buy better food; you know, he likes to see the children get happy. But I </p>
    <p>say we better eat the same food, but not extra-so we can maybe save for when his job stops. </p>
    <p>"When I was married my mother hadn't never told me nothing about life or nothing like that. I was as innocent as the </p>
    <p>day I was born. When she used to want to talk about those things she would look at me and I would have to leave the </p>
    <p>room. I didn't know nothing about how not to have babies-no wonder I had so many. I'm 28 now and got six kids </p>
    <p>and I </p>
    <p>1226 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>s. </p>
    <p>don't want no more. There ain't no use in having kids unless you can give them some of the things they need. The more </p>
    <p>kids you have the less there is to give them. </p>
    <p>"I always had to have a chape rone everywhere. My date had to come to the house mostly and sit in the living room </p>
    <p>with the family and carry on conversation. Ve couldn't even get up and go back to the kitchen for a drink of water </p>
    <p>together; I always had to go get the water toy myself. My date had to leave at nine-thirty, and I wasn't allowed to walk </p>
    <p>to the door with him; X had to say goodbye still sitting down." </p>
    <p>"Cuban customs are crazy anyway," says Rosa. "I'm glad I was born in America." </p>
    <p>"I was born in Key Vest," replies Amanda. "I'm an American just as much as you are. I may come from Cuban </p>
    <p>descent, but I'm 100 percent American just the same." </p>
    <p>"Real American people consider you a Cuban," retorts Rosa. </p>
    <p>"Vhat do I care what they consider me so long as I am an American?" asks Amanda. "Heck yeah, I'm an American- </p>
    <p>alnt I on the VPAT </p>
    <p>"The relief station here gives away lots of good things. They give me nice clothes for the children; and they give us </p>
    <p>can meat, and flour, and lots of things. It's real good stuff, too, and helps out plenty. I heard that Roosevelt was going </p>
    <p>to start giving away lots more things like that, and start selling things very cheap to poor people on relief. It sure will </p>
    <p>be wonderful if he does. </p>
    <p>"Do you like grapefruit juice? I'm going to give you some cans of it I got at the relief station. It carries one pint in each </p>
    <p>can. Grapefruit juice makes very good drinks with rum. I get cans of it all the </p>
    <p>1227 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>time-last time they give me five cans. I fixed some of it nice in glasses with ice and sugar for the kids, hut they donft </p>
    <p>like it and won't drink it. They like the fruit, hut they won't drink the juice. </p>
    <p>"Food is pretty cheap in Yhor City-I get milk for 10^ a quart-hut even so, lots of people do not have enough money </p>
    <p>to "buy to eat. I have seen people go to the meat market and ask for free scraps for dogs, and then cook the scraps and </p>
    <p>make soup to drink. </p>
    <p>"Enrique used to have a little 'buckeye' cigar factory of his own. He had 12 men working for him at one time, hut you </p>
    <p>know he didn't have enough capital to keep going. He had to buy all his material for cash and sell for credit, so he </p>
    <p>needed more capital than he had. He is a good "business man and was doing good with it for awhile. </p>
    <p>"My one ambition is for my kids to finish school and maybe even go to college. That's the main reason I wish Enrique </p>
    <p>could get started with his own buckeye again-so maybe he could make enough money to send the boys to college. If </p>
    <p>I had the means I sure would help him get started in his own factory again. </p>
    <p>"He did try to borrow money but the hanks wouldn't lend him any because he didn't have enough security, and he </p>
    <p>didn't know nobody else who could lend him any. He wants so hard to start a buckeye of his own again; that's all he's </p>
    <p>living for, the day he can start again. Look: he picked out this label from a catalogue. He's saving all these labels in </p>
    <p>case he starts up again. I think it was the prettiest one; nobody can use this label hut him because he bought the rights </p>
    <p>to it. It looks like he will never be able to get started again, hut while there is life there </p>
    <p>is hope, they say." </p>
    <p>: . 1228 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Looka all these cigars "behind this door," says Enrique. "I keep them hid here for a friend of mine who has a little </p>
    <p>"buckeye factory. Eight now, the first of the year, the customs checks up on all cigars and collects for revenue stamps </p>
    <p>on them. Diaz-he's my friend-he keep these cigar here so he won't have to pay no revenue. That's about the only </p>
    <p>way he is able to make any money, cigars sell so cheap now. </p>
    <p>"Diaz has gone over to St. Petersburg to sell some boxes of cigars to the tourist, without no stamps on them. </p>
    <p>Sometimes he gets low with money, so he makes up extra good cigars and sells them to tourists like that; he sells them </p>
    <p>dearer, hut they is hotter cigars. By not paying revenue on them he makes money pretty good. But that's dangerous, all </p>
    <p>right; you know, he might walk up to an officer or something. </p>
    <p>wHe used to he the "biggest "bootlegger in Tbor City during the prohibition. He had $60,000 in the hank at one time, </p>
    <p>and now he no have nothing. The police took it all in fines and "bribes to get him out of jail. Diaz used to he plenty </p>
    <p>tough. But he's getting more old and soft now; he says so long as he has to eat and a little money to spend he is going </p>
    <p>to enjoy himself while he is alive. </p>
    <p>"In the factory I work in now, I make 30^ an nour hut it's not regular work all the time. The days what we are working </p>
    <p>we make about $2.30; that's not so bad as a lot of people makes. The smallest amount they pay in the factories now is </p>
    <p>$10 a week and you have to work very fast on account of the wage hour law making wages high and unless you can </p>
    <p>work fast and good the company will fire you. </p>
    <p>"There aint no young people-very young-working in the factories. The Government won't allow it. A few years ago </p>
    <p>they found two boys working </p>
    <p>1229 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>11. </p>
    <p>who were 17 years old, and they made the "boys quit the factory and go hack to school. They wouldn't have "been </p>
    <p>hired in the first place if they hadn't lied about their age. </p>
    <p>"There is quite a few crackers working in the factories now; most of them came from Georgia." </p>
    <p>"You know what's the matter with them cracker people?" interrupts Amanda. "They live so far out the running water </p>
    <p>aint got there yet." </p>
    <p>"We used to make $55 a week," Enrique continues, "hut now don't nobody make much more than about $18. I guess </p>
    <p>it's mostly because the machines can make cigars so cheap; you can buy the best kind of cigar now, 2 for 5#. And aint </p>
    <p>nobody smoking cigars like they used to; young people all smoking cigarettes. Cigars is going out of style. </p>
    <p>"In the days when we made $55 &amp; week we didn't have no unions. Maybe that's why we got so much pay-when we </p>
    <p>used to strike we always won, but since the unions organized we aint won a strike. We used to go on strike and </p>
    <p>everybody stick together good; you know. Key West and Cuba would send help, sometimes five percent of our wages, </p>
    <p>to take care of our families while we on strike. Of course, the people in Key West is all on relief now. </p>
    <p>"This APofL union is no benefit to us. Before we can strike now we have to get permission from the Florida union </p>
    <p>officers, and they have to get permission from the national union officers, and they won't let us strike. If we go ahead </p>
    <p>and strike anyway without permission we all lose our jobs at the factories and there is plenty workers to take our </p>
    <p>places. </p>
    <p>"Roosevelt, he is the one make the-what you call it-um-Lewis. </p>
    <p>CIO, that's right. Roosevelt don't make it, but he make it grow good, </p>
    <p>1230 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>12. </p>
    <p>you know. He say CIO is all right. He prove he like the CIO the way he put good men on the Labor Board and the </p>
    <p>Supreme Court. </p>
    <p>"There is a closed shop in all the cigar factories in Tampa. You see, the factory owners they like the AFofL union and </p>
    <p>they make the closed shop so nobody who is not in AFofL union can get a job. </p>
    <p>"Of course most of the men, they like the CIO, but there is nothing they can do about it. Because if they break up the </p>
    <p>AFofL union and have the strike, the factory owners, sheriff, police, judges and everybody like that is for the APofL </p>
    <p>union. Besides, there is plenty of men who would work the factories and break the strike. </p>
    <p>"I guess you saw in the papers about the national officer of the APofL cigarmakers' union coming to Tampa and </p>
    <p>suspending the guiding committee elected by the local unions. The committee was trying to get the men to make the </p>
    <p>CIO union. They had a long fuss in the courts with the national officer. The unions elected another guiding </p>
    <p>committee-it was funny, the new committee wanted the CIO just as much as the suspended men did. At last the </p>
    <p>national officer agreed to let the suspended men come back in the union if they would promise not to be officers for a </p>
    <p>year. </p>
    <p>"One time the Ku Klux Klan paraded through Ybor City to break up a strike. Everybody just got their shot guns and </p>
    <p>came out and sat on the porch with their guns and watched the parade. It sure was a quiet parade, and it didn't last very </p>
    <p>long. Man, it was a good thing the Klan didn't start no trouble or there sure would have been revolution or something </p>
    <p>over herei The Klan don't want no talk of communism going on. Neither do the factory owners, sheriff, police, or </p>
    <p>judges. They all work together </p>
    <p>1231 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>13. </p>
    <p>just like that. </p>
    <p>NI read in the papers about the Elan parading over in Lakeland, trying to stop the citrus workers1 strike. But it din't do </p>
    <p>no good. The citrus union wrote a letter to the longshoremens' union, and the longshoremen stopped handling the </p>
    <p>fruit-which was being packed by scab laborers-and they also got the seamens1 union to stop shipping it. A-nd in </p>
    <p>New York, somebody was picketing the fruit stands in the market. That was real cooperation. </p>
    <p>"Of course they was very lucky to not have no dishonest judge in Lakeland; the judge would not give the companies an </p>
    <p>unjunction to stop the picketing of the packing plants. </p>
    <p>"Citrus is a perishable food, and unless it is handled quickly it rots and the owners lose money. With cigars it is very </p>
    <p>different. All the factories have thousands of cigars stored up, and in case there is a strike, they have plenty cigars to </p>
    <p>last a long time. That is why the companies win the strikes, because the cigars will keep a long time. The companies </p>
    <p>have enough money to hold out for years, while the workers do not even have to eat for their families. If the workers </p>
    <p>just had enough to eat maybe they could win the strikes more better. </p>
    <p>"The wage-hour law is funny. The government make that law so things would be more better for workers; so they </p>
    <p>would get more money and not have to work so long. But it is not working like that. More than 2,(XX) mens have </p>
    <p>done lost their jobs from the cigar factories in Tampa because of that law. The factory owners say they no can make </p>
    <p>any profit if they pay the workers so much money, so they fire the workers and put that work on machines. Of course, </p>
    <p>the factory owners can afford to pay more </p>
    <p>. 1232 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>wages, hut they say they can't, and that's all there is to it. They want to keep all the profit for themselves. </p>
    <p>"That law is playing hell with the little buckeye factories, too. Buckeye owners can't pay their workers no more than </p>
    <p>75^ or $1 a day, so unless they get exempt from that law I guess they have to go out of business. </p>
    <p>"The national officer of the cigarmakers' union-the one who suspended our officers for trying to start the CIO-is </p>
    <p>trying to get the cigar industry exempt from the wage hour law. He says that is the only way those mens what have </p>
    <p>been fired can get their jobs back. But the way I think it, the Government ought to make the company take back those </p>
    <p>mens and keep up with the law, or else why did they pass a law like that in the first place. </p>
    <p>"All these new kind of insurance the Government has made the companies start for the workers is all right. There was </p>
    <p>a man in our factory got hurt with a saw not long ago, and he was in bed one week and that insurance pay him just the </p>
    <p>same as if he was at work. Man, that's all right; we never had nothing like that before. </p>
    <p>"In the G-asparilla parade in I93O the Hav-A-Tampa float had a beautiful Cuban girl on it-she was beautiful-and </p>
    <p>they had her, almost naked, painted all over with gold paint. Eight after the parade she got sick and she was sick for </p>
    <p>two days and died. The doctor said the paint had poisoned her. Of course her family didn't get paid anything. </p>
    <p>"In the National Maritime Union sit-down strike on the S.S. CUBA, while it was in Tampa all the men went on strike </p>
    <p>but one-he was a Key West man. They all sit down on the ship. We heard they was on strike, you know, so we went </p>
    <p>down to the dock to see what was haoTDening and how </p>
    <p>1233 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>15. </p>
    <p>they getting along. They had picket lines all around the dock. Some of the men asked us to bring them a copy of the </p>
    <p>paper and some cigarettes and we did. When we got hack it was raining like hell and the picket lines were standing out </p>
    <p>in the rain. Then the policemen drove up with two Dig open trucks, and they went on the ship with their "blackjacks </p>
    <p>and guns and arrested everybody and put them in the trucks. </p>
    <p>"They put all them men in them trucks and they was packed in just like cattle. They drove to the jail standing up in the </p>
    <p>trucks in the rain and singing all the way. They sing all kinda songs and say they aint gonna "be in jail long. </p>
    <p>"All our cigar unions took up a collection and also went to a loan company and borrowed money to pay the fines for </p>
    <p>the strikers so they could get out of jail. We sent cigars and cigarettes to the jail for them and the restaurants in Ybor </p>
    <p>City sent good food free. All the food and cigarettes was searched good before they would give it to the men in jail. </p>
    <p>For a long time after the men got out of jail we cigar union men paid 10^ a week to pay back the loan company for the </p>
    <p>fine money. But now the national office of the NMU is paying us all back. </p>
    <p>"This morning everybody is supposed to start to register for the social security. I am going down to register this </p>
    <p>morning at the Labor Temple if you want to come with me. M </p>
    <p>Perico suddenly becomes attentive. "Let me go with you," he says to me, "and then when you leave daddy you won't </p>
    <p>have to ride back all by yourself." </p>
    <p>"Smart kid, huh?" says Enrique, and chases Perico out of the house. </p>
    <p>1234 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>16. </p>
    <p>So Enrique and I drive to the Labor Temple alone. </p>
    <p>"I am not sure about how this social security works yet," he says, "but I think it is this way: if you do not go to </p>
    <p>work-I mean if the factory is not open-then the factory and the Government have the social insurance together </p>
    <p>which they pay you for about three or four months. They only pay you a certain percent of your average salary; I don't </p>
    <p>know how much, but it sure sounds good, all right. You can't get anything, though, unless you register. Everybody is </p>
    <p>registering." </p>
    <p>The Labor Temple is surrounded by a noisy crowd of men, women, children, and dogs; the activity reminds me of </p>
    <p>typical scenes at voting polls. Enrique leaves me and take his place in the line of people waiting to register. Although </p>
    <p>all conversation is in Spanish, I hear frequent interjections in English, such as, "OK," and "That's nice." </p>
    <p>I decide to enter the building, and as I walk through the entrance I am immediately approached by a Cuban man who </p>
    <p>asks: </p>
    <p>"You Americano? You sign the petition to lift the embargo on Spain?" He has a card table erected near the doorway, </p>
    <p>and approaches everyone who enters. </p>
    <p>I tell him that I am a member of the Jacksonville branch of the Medical Bureau and Forth American Committee to Aid </p>
    <p>Spanish Democracy, and he re spends enthus iast i cally. </p>
    <p>He calls to a stocky Cuban man who is drinking a Coca-Cola at the drink stand. </p>
    <p>"This is Mr. Ginesta," he says. "He is the Tampa chairman of the Spanish Aid Committee." </p>
    <p>"I am pleased to meet you," says Ginesta. "I hope you will be here </p>
    <p>1235 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>17. </p>
    <p>for the meeting when we sponsor two young ladles who are touring the country in a 'wounded ambulance. ' One of the </p>
    <p>young ladies drove the ambulance for Loyalist Spain, and the other was a nurse. The Tampa Ministerial Alliance is </p>
    <p>going to co-sponsor the meeting with us; it will be the first time in this country that a ministerial alliance has done </p>
    <p>that. And for the first time we will get the Americans in Tampa to our meetings. </p>
    <p>"Ginesta just returned from Washington a few weeks ago, N explains the other man. "In a few days he is going back to </p>
    <p>Washington again to attend as a delegate to the Congress for Peace and Democracy." </p>
    <p>"Tea, I learn plenty in Washington,  Sinesta says. "I went with a delegation to ask Congressmen to lift the embargo </p>
    <p>on Spain. Man, we got a good friend in Claude Pepper; Pepper, he is a good guy. There wee another Congressman </p>
    <p>who told to us: 'You are from Florida and not my constituents, but in your request you represent the majority of the </p>
    <p>American people, and so do I.' That sure make us feel good. </p>
    <p>"There was another Congressman who said: Tes, I will vote to lift the embargo on Spain this time. -But listen, I </p>
    <p>want you to understand that it is not I who have changed my views since I voted against lifting the embargo last year. </p>
    <p>It is the situation that has changed.1 You see, he didn't want us to say that we were right and he was wrong, or that he </p>
    <p>had swung around to our point of view. Munich, the Lima Conference, and President Roosevelt's speeches sure are </p>
    <p>waking a lot of people up. </p>
    <p>Tou should have seen us when we went into Senator George's office, from Georgia; we almost got thrown out. I don't </p>
    <p>guess there has been a Spaniard in Georgia since DeSoto marched through. </p>
    <p>"I learned a lot in Washington, all right. I watched those guys </p>
    <p>1236 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>18. </p>
    <p>work and I know there are very few real liberals. Most of them are uneducated and crooked politicians controlled by </p>
    <p>the big interests.R </p>
    <p>A young man who has been standing behind Ginesta, listening to the conversation, steps up and whispers cautiously to </p>
    <p>him: "You must be more quieter and not talk too much because the woman selling drinks at the cold drink stand is a </p>
    <p>Ku Klux Klan so you better be careful." </p>
    <p>"I was just talking about the Spanish Aid committee," replies Ginesta, "but the Elan don't like it so I guess I might as </p>
    <p>well be careful.-Do you know Pershing, who is field representative for the Spanish committee? Well, he spoke here </p>
    <p>in the Labor Temple not long ago. He is very good, all right. At the meeting he read a note he had received at the hotel </p>
    <p>that said: 'Tampa is an unhealthy place for liberals.' After he read the note he said: 'Whoever wrote that note should </p>
    <p>be sent one saying not to come over here because Tbor City is an unhealthy place for fascists.' Everybody laugh; they </p>
    <p>sure like Pershings." </p>
    <p>Enrique approaches, having duly registered, and nods to Ginesta and the others. "Give my regards to our friends in </p>
    <p>Jacksonville," says Ginesta as I tell him goodbye. When we leave, I see over the front entrance a large poster labelled: </p>
    <p>SOLIDARITY WITH THE VICTIMS OF WORLD FASCISM: </p>
    <p>"Those were very intelligent mens you were talking to," Enrique says. "They are leaders in the unions, the newspapers, </p>
    <p>the Spanish Aid Committee, and all like that. You know, all the unions make I don't know how many h~\ -thousand </p>
    <p>cigars and cigarettes to send to Spain-we stayed in the factories and work overtime to make those things for Spain. </p>
    <p>"The Spanish Aid committee has two mens to stand by the factory door everytlme we get Day; one of the men takes a </p>
    <p>collection to help Spain, and </p>
    <p>1237 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>19. </p>
    <p>the other man writes the receipts for whatever you give. It is almost like "buying bolita, the way they work it-you can </p>
    <p>"buy a 5^ piece or as much more as you want. Giving receipts that way nobody can never say any of the money is </p>
    <p>missing. And they print in the paper the record of how much every man give. " </p>
    <p>Although it is only two o'clock in the afternoon when we return to the house, Amanda, is already considering what she </p>
    <p>should cook for the evening meal, which is eaten at four o'clock. She explains that it is Cuban custom to eat at four, </p>
    <p>because that allows time to clean up the kitchen before night; and also, when they retire early* the food is thoroughly </p>
    <p>digested before they go to sleep. </p>
    <p>"What would you all like to eat for supper?" she asks. "We want to fix something you like. I don't know much about </p>
    <p>cooking American dinners. </p>
    <p>"We don't want American food," says Edith. "I'm sick and tired of eating American food; it hasn't got any taste to it. </p>
    <p>That's one reason why I came to Tampa: so I could eat some good Cuban food." </p>
    <p>"I know a man who sells crabs," says Enrique. "If I can just find him while he is drunk-he stays drunk most of the </p>
    <p>time-I can get three dozen crabs for 50. Crabs makes very good enchilado." </p>
    <p>"My husband likes enchilado, frijoles negrfr(black beans), garbanzos (Spanish^beans), arros con polio (rice with </p>
    <p>chicken); he likes all Cuban things, plenty hot," Edith says. </p>
    <p>"I know," Enrique says, "I make the empanada. You know, the shrimp all crushed up and cook with hot sauce and then </p>
    <p>fry inside little long rolls of dough. The dough cooks crisp and you bite into the good hot shrimp. I think maybe you </p>
    <p>like that all right." </p>
    <p>1238 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>20. </p>
    <p>He hurries off to the store to "buy the necessary ingredients. When he returns, he goes to the kitchen and "begins </p>
    <p>preparing the meal, while Amanda sits in the front room and listens to the radio. WI sure got me a good cook for a </p>
    <p>husband," she says. "Enrique cooks lots more "better than I do, and he likes to, so I'm glad to let him do it. You know, </p>
    <p>most all Cuban men is good cooks.11 </p>
    <p>I sit in the kitchen window and watch Enrique. The entire house is permeated with the odor of the sauce which he </p>
    <p>prepares ty frying finely chopped onion, garlic, green and red peppers in tomato paste and olive oil. When the shrimp </p>
    <p>are boiled, he pulls them into shreds with his fingers. The sauce is strained to remove the onion, garlic, and peppers, </p>
    <p>and then mixed with the shrimp. Dough is made of flour, "baking powder, and water, and portions of shrimp are </p>
    <p>encased in it. The empanadas are then fried in very hot lard, and come out crisp and golden "brown. </p>
    <p>He has made a large pot of rice, which he strains and then steams with the addition of a tablespoon of lard. He </p>
    <p>prepares a salad of sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce, and pours over it a dressing of salt, pepper, olive oil and </p>
    <p>vinegar. He pours four large glasses of home-made raisin wine, and smaller glasses for the children. </p>
    <p>Someone shouts "Hello" from the front porch, enters, and walks on down the hall. "This is Miss Caridad Martinez," </p>
    <p>says Amanda. "She is a very good friend to us who wanted to meet you." </p>
    <p>Caridad is about 19 years old; her complexion is very light, her eyes large and dark, and her hair naturally waved. She </p>
    <p>remains a few minutes, laughing and joking in Spanish. When she leaves, she says in English, "I'm very glad to have </p>
    <p>met you." </p>
    <p>1239 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>21. </p>
    <p>After she has gone Amanda says, "Poor Carldad-she's got TB. Three of her sisters died with it in the last three years. </p>
    <p>Now Caridad is going to die with it, the last one, and her mother just looks at her all the time and cries. It hurts her </p>
    <p>mother to know that Caridad is going to die, too, like all the others. Her mother fusses at her all the time hut it is only </p>
    <p>because she is so worried about her dying. They are a very nice family and the girls were beautiful." </p>
    <p>When the cooking is over and the meal placed on the table, there is a sudden burst of very rapid and excited Spanish </p>
    <p>which I am unable to understand. Perlco dashes out of the front door. I ask what has happened, but receive no answer. </p>
    <p>In a few minutes Perico returns, and there is more rapid talking in Spanish. The dinner is getting cold. </p>
    <p>At last Amanda says, "Well, I guess you might as well know; we been trying to borrow some knives from the </p>
    <p>neighbors but none of them has got any either. I guess we will have to use the big knife and pass it around the table. </p>
    <p>I'm so ashamed not to have no knives, butwwe don't never use any. M </p>
    <p>We all gather about the small table. "Just help yourself to everything," invites Amanda. Perico tears the end off of a </p>
    <p>hot loaf of Cuban bread. His hands are extremely dirty. </p>
    <p>"Perico.1  shouts Amanda. "Get up from here and wash your hands.1 You know better than to sit down to eat with </p>
    <p>your hands like that." </p>
    <p>I am suddenly startled by a loud "Mooo..." from directly under the kitchen window. Everyone laughs loudly. </p>
    <p>"What's a cow doing so close?" I ask. </p>
    <p>"That was no cow," says Enrique, "That was a^cagrabsuLle- -a horse- </p>
    <p>1240 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>22. </p>
    <p>poop-pooping!w </p>
    <p>They all laugh louder than ever. "Sure it was a cow," says Estrella, "Enrique ought to he ashamed telling jokes like that </p>
    <p>at the dinner table. The neighbor's keep their cow in a shed right under the window." </p>
    <p>"That remind me of a good joke," says Enrique. "One time there was an old man who had a horse named 'Bertha,' and </p>
    <p>his daughter was named 'Bertha' too. There was a young man who wanted to borrow the horse one day, so he asked </p>
    <p>the old man if he could borrow Bertha for a little while. The old man grabbed his gun and say, 'Eell no, what you think </p>
    <p>this is- you think I let you try out my daughter?'" </p>
    <p>The response to this joke almost upsets the table. </p>
    <p>"I notice you don't laugh so much like the Latin people," Amanda, says to me. "I guess you feel good and just don't </p>
    <p>laugh so much. I think that is all right. But I just can't help laughing. You should hear me in thepicture show; </p>
    <p>sometime when I see something real funny I laugh so much I have to go outside to stop from laughing so much." </p>
    <p>"Would you like to go for a ride?" asks Edith, after the table has been cleared. </p>
    <p>"Yes, sure, anything you all want to do," replies Amanda. "You go put on your suit, Enrique; we are going for a ride </p>
    <p>and I like to see you dressed up in your suit." </p>
    <p>After a few minutes Enrique appears in a neatly pressed brown suit. </p>
    <p>"He won that suit at a lottery for $1," says Amanda. "The man told him if he wanted to buy an extra pair of pants to </p>
    <p>match, it would cost him $6. I told him to go ahead and get the extra pants because that way the suit would be good for </p>
    <p>twice as long as if he only had one pair of </p>
    <p>1241 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>23. </p>
    <p>pants. I bought him that crepe shirt he's wearing, for Christmas. It cost $2." </p>
    <p>Amanda is rolling her hair on a clothes-pin. "I fix hair pretty good, huh?" she asks. "You know I don't get to go to the </p>
    <p>beauty parlor but about once a year. They don't do it so good as I do sometimes; I taught some of the girls in the </p>
    <p>beauty parlor how to fix hair more better." </p>
    <p>In due time we are ready to leave. "Let's drive over to Tampa tonight," suggests Edith. "We saw all there is to see of </p>
    <p>Tbor City last night." </p>
    <p>In Tampa, we drive slowly so Edith and Amanda can look in the shop windows. Each window evokes some such </p>
    <p>comment, in Spanish, as: "Que lindol" (How pretty) "Quebonito!" (How beautiful) "Divinoi" (Divine) "No me gusta!" </p>
    <p>(I don't like it). </p>
    <p>"That's the jail Shoemaker was taken out of," says Enrique. "Right in the middle of town. They took him out and sat </p>
    <p>him down in a bucket of hot tar, castrated him, beat him, and did all kinds of things to him. I have heard people argue </p>
    <p>about whether the Klan, or the police, or both, did it. All I know is that they took him right out of jail. </p>
    <p>"I been in that jail. One night when I was walking home along the bridge I saw a lady climb over the rail and get ready </p>
    <p>to jump in and commit suicide, so I grabbed her around the waist and held on and she yelled and raised all kinds of </p>
    <p>hell. The police came, and I guess they thought we was fighting; anyway, they took us both to jail and told us we </p>
    <p>could tell it to the judge. I stayed in that jail seven days before Amanda could borrow &amp;10 to pay my fine to get me </p>
    <p>out." </p>
    <p>We drive over a bridge into a residential section of large homes and well-kept lawns. </p>
    <p>1242 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>m: </p>
    <p>"This is Davis Island,n says Amanda. "This where all the millionaires and rich people live. It's very pretty in the </p>
    <p>daytime but you can't see much now. That's the...no, that's not it." </p>
    <p>"Amanda, you don't know nothing about this part of town," says Enrique. </p>
    <p>"I've only rode over here on the Davis Island once or twice," Amanda, admits. "I tell you what you ought to go see: </p>
    <p>the museum in the Tampa Bay Hotel. They have lots of things in there very old, thousands of years old. I like it in </p>
    <p>there. I only been there one time but that time I stayed three hours looking at all those things. It sure is interesting. I </p>
    <p>hope you go there before you leave; you would like it." </p>
    <p>On the way home we stop at a barbecue stand. When we reach the house, Rosa is sitting on the railing of the front </p>
    <p>porch, looking up into the sky. </p>
    <p>"Well, I guess you don't have to worry no more about having an Italian for a son-in-law," she tells Amanda dejectedly. </p>
    <p>"Nicky and I had a fight and he went away mad. I guess it's a good thing. We didn't get along so good anyway." </p>
    <p>"I'm glad you find out now before you married him," comments Amanda. </p>
    <p>We are given the front sleeping room. </p>
    <p>The next morning we are awakened by Rosa who calls, "Tour coffee is ready." </p>
    <p>"Huh," says Edith, "That's not Cuban custom-Cuban custom everybody eats when they feel like." </p>
    <p>We are served coffee and hot bread, and prepare to depart for Jacksonville. Enrique and Amanda present us with a </p>
    <p>package of sandwiches to take with us for lunch, several cans of the surplus commodity grapefruit juice, and a pound </p>
    <p>of black beans. </p>
    <p>1243 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>25. </p>
    <p>"We wish we could give you something more better to take with you," Amanda says, "but Enrique hasn't worked any </p>
    <p>in the last few weeks and we are short on cash. " </p>
    <p>As we start out the front door, the children in the bedroom shout: "Goodbye-Goodbye-come-again.'" </p>
    <p>"Goodbye,11 we call. "And Eosa,  I say, "don't get married before I get back to Tampa, and I  11 bring you a nice </p>
    <p>American for a husband." </p>
    <p>"All right," she says, "I'll wait." </p>
    <p>"I want to come visit you in Jacksonville sometime," Amanda, says, "but I don't know when I'll ever be able to leave </p>
    <p>these kids. I aint got nobody to look after them while I'm gone. I never been nowhere except Key West, Miami, and </p>
    <p>Tampa, and I always wanted to see Jacksonville before I die...Well, hurry up and beat it. And don't say 'goodbye.'3 </p>
    <p>Say, "haata la vista-until we meet again.  " </p>
    <p>One week after our return to Jacksonville, we receive a penciled postcard from Amanda. It concludes: "Rosa married </p>
    <p>Kicky and they are living with his family in West Tampa." </p>
