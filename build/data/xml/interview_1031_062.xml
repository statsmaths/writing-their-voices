    <p>TOM CONDUS</p>
    <p>(Church Janitor)</p>
    <p>Tom Condus is the American name of a small white-haired Greek, whoso sunny smile and amiable disposition marks him as a man who has cultivated the habit of getting the most fun possible out of life This estimate of Tom is borne out by the following story of his life:</p>
    <p>"I was born near Macedonia, Greece in 1880. My parents were poor: my father being a goat herder. When I was old enough I went to school for three years and then went to work with my father helping with the goats.</p>
    <p>"When I was about 16 years old I got a small herd of my own I kept my goats in the hills in summer and drove them down into the valleys in the winter where it was warmer As my herd got larger I sold the milk which was used for making choose, and the money I gave to my father.</p>
    <p>"In 1904 when I was twenty four years old I had six hundred goats, so I got married My wife helped no taka care of my hard and in 1905 I decided to come to America, as I had heard it was a wonderful country I went from Athens to Naples Italy in a small boat.</p>
    <p>Sailing from there to Beston, Mass in a large boat. We were twenty days crossing the ocean. I had a good time on the boat, plenty of wine and not sick.</p>
    <p>"I was in Boston about a week and then I went to Lowell, Mass I got a Job in a cotton mill working on a drawing framo at is a week, I worked there for a month and then got a Job in a cotton mill at Buffolk. I worked in the picker.</p>
    <p>room for $7 a week After working there about a month the dust and dirt made me sick and I quit I than got work: it a shoe factory in Lowell, Mass I did not like the work, it was too hard, so after a month I left.</p>
    <p>"I went to Manchester, W. H., there I got work at the Amoskeag Mill scrubbing floors a in the weave room. I wanted to learn to weave, so all my spare time I helped the weavers. After about four weeks scrubbing floors the boss put me in the weave room to learn. I worked two months with no pay and then I started weaving, getting $8 a weak for running a set of eight looms. I worked on this Job a year. Then went back to lowell and got work in a woolen mill weaving blankets. I worked there about three months."</p>
    <p>At this point Tom said "I could always get work, but never stayed long in one place."</p>
    <p>"After leaving Lowell I went back to Manchester, N. H to the Amoskeag Mill working as a weaver about two and a half years.</p>
    <p>"In 1908 I went home to Greece on the same boat that I came to America on, I paid $24.00 for my ticket and had $200.00 in my pocket.</p>
    <p>"I was in Greece for a year with my family and friends and had a good time.</p>
    <p>"In 1909 I returned to America, going again to Lowell. Mass., where I had many friends I went to work in a cotton mill, weaving, and stayed there a year.</p>
    <p>"In 1910 my cousin who lived in San Francisco, Cal., where he had a large shoe shining parlor, wrote to me telling me what a fine piece it was, so I went out there and worked with him for two years.</p>
    <p>"In 1912 he sold out his business and went back to Greece to fight in the Balkan War, I stayed in San Francisco about three months after he left, working in a cigar factory, I did not like the work so I quit.</p>
    <p>"Late in 1912 I went back to Lowell, Mass., getting work in the weave room at e cotton mill and worked there for two years. In 1914 I went to Manchester, N.H., where I worked for four years as a weaver at $20. A week. I got tired of Manchester, so went to mill at New Bedford, Mass., where I worked two years.</p>
    <p>"In 1920 I went to a mill at jewitt City, Conn., where I ran twenty looms making $50 to $60 some weeks. I worked there four years.</p>
    <p>"I had saved a little money so in 1924 I went out to San Francisco, Gal. again and opened a small shoe shining place of my own I liked it there, good weather, pretty parks, plenty places to rich and nice people After I was there a big labor fight started and the big fellows run all the little fellows out of business and I lost of my money.</p>
    <p>"I left San Francisco going to a little place, In southern California, named Hamilton. I worked in a sugar factory there for three or four months and had enough money to come back Rost.</p>
    <p>"I had heard that there were many cotton mills in the south so went to Spartanburg, S. C, The first day I was in Spartanburg I went to the sparten Mill. I asked a men in the mill,' There the boss? 'At dinner' he  said I asked how much weavers made and he said$30 to $33. I told him that would not pay pay board and buy oigaretts and left. I went to the Railroad Station and asked the ticket man what the fare was to Utics, N. Y., he  told me $32.00 I did not have that much money so I went to work in a little mill outside of Spartenburg where I worked a month*</p>
    <p>"When I left South Carolina I came to Charlotte,  went to work at Highland Park Mill and worked there for 12 or 13 years. About a year ago the boss let me out saying I was getting too old I told him O.K, by me.</p>
    <p>" I now take care of the Greek Church, get $4. a week and a nice room in the church which is a good Job for an old man.</p>
    <p>"No, I never was naturalized. I took out my first papers in New Hampshire in 1918. I was going to join the Army but was not accepted so I never took out my other papers.</p>
    <p>l am not like other Greeks I never saved my money when I was young I wanted a good time, plenty of wine, lots of girls and everything; that is why I am a poor man."</p>
