    <p>LIFE STORIES</p>
    <p>HAKI GUNNAWAY</p>
    <p>2715 MILLWOOD AVENUE</p>
    <p>COLUMBIA., S. C.  </p>
    <p/>
    <p>Mary Gunnaway, a Negro octogenarian,lives in a renovated outhouse on the</p>
    <p>grounds of Mrs. F. C. Hoefer at 2715 Millwood Avenue, Columbia, South Carolina.</p>
    <p>Her little one-room cabin nestles in the spacious backyard of a big, white oldfashioned home, and gives a pleasing rustle effect to the grounds. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>A gentle tap on the door brought the sound of a creaking chair, then the</p>
    <p>shuffling of footsteps inside. The door was opened by a small, old Negro woman.</p>
    <p>She was dressed in a short checked sweater, black woolen skirt, and a white apron,</p>
    <p>around her head was tied a white rag, and over this she wore a small black felt</p>
    <p>hat. She also wore large gold earrings. Her face was careworn and wrinkled with</p>
    <p>age, but, with a cherry "good morning," I was ushered into the home and presence</p>
    <p>of my ancient hostess. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>It was a chilly November day, and the glowing coals and steaming kettle gave</p>
    <p>me a feeling of warmth and welcome, and it pleased her when I told her that. I</p>
    <p>was given a low chair by the hearth and she took a similar one. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Aunt Mary, I've heard so much about you from my friend, Mrs. Hoefer (Hafer).</p>
    <p>For a long time I've wanted to come in and have a little chat with you." At the</p>
    <p>mention of Mrs. Hoefer's name, her face became animated, and her small black eyes</p>
    <p>sparkled, when suddenly she brushed a tear away with the back of her gnarled and</p>
    <p>bony old hand. "Thems good folks, praise God, thems good folks!"  </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"You see dis house I's living in. Mis' Hoefer she done it. After my husband</p>
    <p>died, and no chillun or nobody to hep me, the white folks say I hafter go to Poor</p>
    <p>House. When de ole haid die everthing go to rack. So I came here to Mis' Hoefer,</p>
    <p>and I cry and I beg her to take me, jest put me anywheres so's to hide me from de</p>
    <p>Poor House. Dis wus de chicken house, she tuk en boarded hit up, put in de fireplace, </p>
    <p>de window, en da door, en give hit to me long as I live. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Sam, my husband, had de chills en fever, en he jest fell off to skin en bones.</p>
    <p>When he died, I tuk down wid rheumatism, en couldn't work, and dat's when I come</p>
    <p>here to Mis' Hoefer. She knowed my Ma and Pa, en I knowed she would hope me. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Praise de Lord deys good folks! I washed de clothes en I nussed her Billy</p>
    <p>when he wus a baby. I never thought I'd live to see him git learning, but he sho'</p>
    <p>is got learning, and keep learning more out here at dat new school." </p>
    <p/>
    <p>I looked around the little one-room shack which constituted a happy home to</p>
    <p>this old darkey. In one corner stood a pale blue iron bed, and in another an oldfashioned </p>
    <p>dresser, the remaining furnishings consisted of four low chairs, a table,</p>
    <p>a few dishes, a trunk and numerous boxes. She seemed to notice that I was taking</p>
    <p>undue note of the surroundings, when she proudly said: "I use to have heap more</p>
    <p>'en dis, but I give hit all away," and she reached under the bed and pulled out a</p>
    <p>flat giant-size clothes basket, proudly boasting of many a beautiful wash she had</p>
    <p>carried up and down the big road in that basket during her younger days. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I's so old now I can't git about much. I cleans up my house en sweeps 'round</p>
    <p>de door. I hate it I can't git 'round like I use'to. Some o' dem young gals don't</p>
    <p>do nothin', dey don't do like de old times. All de little chillun out here know</p>
    <p>me, dey say: 'Hey Aunt Mary, wish you could git 'round like us.' </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I hope Marse Billy dig sweet 'tatoes, he cut path wid hoe, so I kin git</p>
    <p>through de weeds. He dig 'em, en I pick 'em up. He say, 'You can't git 'round</p>
    <p>like me.' I say, 'Hush boy, when I's your age you couldn't git 'bout like me.' </p>
    <p>En we jest laughs. Sometime I gits tired jest settln' 'round en doin' nothin',</p>
    <p>so I gits my rake en rakes up de yard en sings. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Marse Billy seed me comin''cross de road de day I went to store for some</p>
    <p>'bacco, en he said: 'You knowed I git your 'bacco if you jest wait 'til I git</p>
    <p>home, sposin' a car come 'long en knock you down.'" At which remark she chuckled </p>
    <p>lustily.   </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I don't know how ole I is. Pa had all our age wrote down in de Book, but</p>
    <p>after he die de Book burn up. When de old haid die everthing go to rack. All of</p>
    <p>um dead en gone. I ain't jest got here. Sometime I feels right feeble, en I</p>
    <p>can't see so good. Mis' Ida give me somethin' to rub wid, when I git dat misery</p>
    <p>in my neck, en hit hopes it. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"My pa was William Gunnaway, en he 'blonged to de Prestons. Pa looked after</p>
    <p>de yard en all de flowers. He use to bring Mis' Ida's mama flowers from de Preston</p>
    <p>place. Pa had three wives, en when he died his last wife's gal got de house en</p>
    <p>everthing, hit wus on House Street. Fore he die, I say: 'Pa, how come you don't</p>
    <p>fix up your will? You'se gittin' old en might drop off.' Pa laugh, en say he</p>
    <p>feel good. Dat very day pa walk all 'round de place, jest keep walkin', en dat</p>
    <p>very nite I hear somebody knock on my door, en say, 'You better come see 'bout</p>
    <p>your pa.' I say, 'Pa all right 'cause I seed him do a sight of walkin' today.</p>
    <p>En he say, 'Your pa daid.' Sho' 'nough he drop off dat very night.  </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Dat gal what didn't 'blong to Pa sold de house, but de man what bought hit</p>
    <p>name Mr. Monroe, en he rent hit to us right cheap, fer seventy-five cents a month,</p>
    <p>en I live there 'til my husband die, 'bout five years. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"My husband name Sam Oliver, en he cook for Mis' Richardson. Me and him work</p>
    <p>on de Frank Sims Place, en he give us three acres o' land to farm. We make bale</p>
    <p>o' cotton every year. We plant on de moon sign en make good crop all de time. On</p>
    <p>day we didn't never work, but go to town, en buy so much things I have to ride</p>
    <p>back. Buy everthing, sugar, coffee, meat, en pretty dress goods. People come to</p>
    <p>see me en say: 'How come you buy so much?' I says 'I likes to have stuff to</p>
    <p>pass 'round to my friends.' En we go to bank o' 'tatoes en gives um 'tatoes. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Country ain't like hit use'to be. Nobody can't tell me hit is, for I know</p>
    <p>hit ain't. I'd git up day break, en cook, en drink ooffee, en take more coffee</p>
    <p>to de field to drink. When twelve o'clock ring fer dinner, my bread done rise up</p>
    <p>en I cooks agin. Times wus good then. I still gits out at day break, I ain't use</p>
    <p>to layin' in de bed. Mis' Ida say: 'How come you gits up so soon?' I say: 'I got</p>
    <p>to clean up en sweep de yard,' en she laugh at me. Man name Bryan bought Frank</p>
    <p>Sims place. He use'to run a livey stable. I sho' miss de ole times. But de Lord</p>
    <p>sho' been good to me to send me here to Mis' Ida, Mis' Ida give me coffee in de</p>
    <p>morning, night en all de time. Den I git de grounds en bile um over. People don't</p>
    <p>make de coffee like dey use'to. I likes to bile do grounds agin. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Deys sho's good folks. When dey go 'way I jest miss um so, I goes out en</p>
    <p>jest look up and down de road. Gal next door say: 'Who you lookin' fer?' I say:</p>
    <p>'Nobody.' Warn't none of her business. If I see somebody pass, I goes right behind </p>
    <p>em en say: 'Who is you?' 'Cause deys liable to break in or do some devilment. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Aunt Mary, somebody came in my home a few days ago, and stole a nice chicken</p>
    <p>I'd baked the night before."  </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"You ain't say: People do dirty tricks dese days. Dey knowed when you wus</p>
    <p>cookin' hit. I don't see how de lord let hit go down de throat so easy. I ain't</p>
    <p>bet nothin' I knows people do's low-down tricks dese days. You lock up your house,</p>
    <p>honey, or de low-life devils will steal all your clothes. I can't live 'mongst dem</p>
    <p>kind of people, but deys a heap o' em. I's always live wid good honest folks. When </p>
    <p>Mr. Hoefer go to Atlanta dat time, he leave me plenty coffee to drink. When he</p>
    <p>come back I 'member he et a big breakfast en he jest sing dat morning. I don't</p>
    <p>'member name of hymn he sing. I say to Mis' Ida, 'What dat he sing?' Hit was</p>
    <p>sho' pretty hymn. He had two pretty bird dogs, en when he left to go to town</p>
    <p>dat morning, dey run up to him en dey jest bark en bark, en I say to Mis' Ida:</p>
    <p>'What make dem dogs bark so strange like?'' En he die dat morning. Dem dogs</p>
    <p>knowed 'bout hit, en give us de sign. I hear'd heap o' signs. In de olden times</p>
    <p>dey b'lieve in um. I hear'd heap o' old grannies say if you confined, don't let</p>
    <p>nobody come in your house en take out any uv your fire, hits bad luck. En don't</p>
    <p>never pay back salt,'cause hits bad luck. If your dish cloth fall on de floor, a</p>
    <p>drunkard comin' to your house. I hear'd all de ole time people say dat.  </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I sho' miss Mis' Ida's ma. When she die I jest holler. One mornin' I see</p>
    <p>de house all tore up, en I say: 'Wonder is Mis' Hoefer daid?' I want in de</p>
    <p>house en everthing seem strange like, en Mis' Ida say, 'Mama's daid.' En I jest</p>
    <p>holler, I couldn't hep hit." After this remark, Aunt Mary pulled an old box from</p>
    <p>a corner in the room, and began displaying most reverently, one garment after</p>
    <p>another that belonged to Miss Ida's mother. She had fallen heir to numerous old</p>
    <p>dresses, sweaters, etc., all several sizes too large for her. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I puts on dis suit when I rides wid Mis' Ida. She give me pair o' brand</p>
    <p>new shoes, too. Brand new, ain't never been wore. Sho' good folks. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I got a brother Efram living down dis same road. He on de Frank Sims place.</p>
    <p>Sister Emma, she daid. I got 'nother sister, she gone off. I don't know if she</p>
    <p>daid or live. She was in Charleston, last time I heard she gone way off down</p>
    <p>yonder to Georgetown. I knowed all ma's folks, but none of my pa's. Pa come from</p>
    <p>Virginia. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Ma died on a Seday, en buried on a Sunday. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I never did went to school in my life, them was slavery times. I never</p>
    <p>did went. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Me en ma en Grandama Philis lived on de Hampton place, name Millwood. My</p>
    <p>grandma cook, ma wash en iron. Dey had big fine wash house, en a big chimley</p>
    <p>where we'd hang pot en cook. Ma tell me 'make some fire 'round dem pots.' </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Dey had a round well, call hit system. One for colored people, one fer</p>
    <p>white, had a house over hit. Had loom house for colored people en everthing.</p>
    <p>Had big place for colored people to play. Had a mill to grind de corn. I wus</p>
    <p>little, but I use'to go grind, too. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I was jest so high when de war come. I 'member de song what we sing 'bout</p>
    <p>de Yankees." At this remark she sang the following with utter abandon, patting</p>
    <p>her knees and keeping time with her feet: </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Yankee gun what comin' tomorrow </p>
    <p>Little gal I'm gwine away, </p>
    <p>Yankee gun what comin' tomorrow </p>
    <p>Little gal I'm gwine away. </p>
    <p>Come on Lindi, Come on Cindi </p>
    <p>Little gal, I'm gwine away. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Yankees burned up everthing. I 'member when dey set all Marse Hampton's</p>
    <p>cotton on fire. I 'member when Yankee throw bomb, en a little boy pick hit up,</p>
    <p>hit went off en blow de little boy up. Yankees burned up everthing, ain't nothin'</p>
    <p>left but de brick at Millwood now, but de same big ole tree I always swing in is</p>
    <p>still standing. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Dem days won't all sad though. No, mam! Dey wus plenty o' big doin's,</p>
    <p>too." She slapped her knee and laughed gleefully at former recollections.   </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Dey had heap o' parties, en dey dance and have fine rashions. De ladies</p>
    <p>had fine dresses. I use to stand en peep through a crack in de door, en when </p>
    <p>Marse Hampton see me, he say: 'Git 'way from dat door.' </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I 'members when dey brought Marse Hampton home, en I seed him when he die." </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Was that General Hampton, Aunt Mary?" "No, mam! Dat wasn't General Hampton, </p>
    <p>dat was Marse Wade Hampton, Governor Hampton. Dem was sad times. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I 'members when heap o' colored people come on de train from Mississippi. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I don't do no cookin' in my house. Lord, child, Mis' Hoefer say I too ole</p>
    <p>to cook, say I burn myself up. She feed me from her kitchen, jest give me all X</p>
    <p>wants to eat. Sometime she let me bake sweet 'tatoes in de pot," and she pointed</p>
    <p>at a dutch oven in a corner of the room. "I bakes 'nough fer dem, too. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I use to go to church in de country, call hit Methodist. Dat House of</p>
    <p>Prayer over on Cherry Street ain't much church. No, mam, dat house ain't much</p>
    <p>church, hit jest want de money. I ain't never stop at dat place. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I don't go no place now, widout Mis' Ida take me. If de moon ain't shining</p>
    <p>I recon' I goes to bed right soon, but when de moon shine, I puts out my lamp en</p>
    <p>sets in de door and smokes my pipe. I kin see better in de moonlight den de sunlight. </p>
    <p>When de moon shine, I don't know how long I sets up. But when I hears dat</p>
    <p>ole rooster crow, I knows its 'bout time fer to go to bed. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I smokes George Washington 'bacco, all I kin git. I takes a little dram,</p>
    <p>too, when I kin git it." </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Well, I'm coming back to see you and bring you some George Washington tobacco,</p>
    <p>and a little dram, too, if I can get it." </p>
    <p/>
    <p>She caught me by the arm and walked with me as far as Mrs. Hoefer's kitchen.</p>
    <p>When on parting she was heard to say. "Mis' Hoefer, I got to go clean up my house</p>
    <p>now, the lady say she comin' back." </p>
