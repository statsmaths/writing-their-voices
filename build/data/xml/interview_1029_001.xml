    <p>June 7, 1939</p>
    <p>MEMORANDUM</p>
    <p>TO, ALL DISTRICT SUPERVISORS AND ACTING SUPERVISORS, FWP</p>
    <p>FROM, STATE DIRECTOR, Edwin Bjorkman</p>
    <p>SUBJECT, GREEK STUDY</p>
    <p>One of our new tasks will be a study of the Greek element in this state, forming part of a nation-wide study of the same kind. I enclose n copy of instructions just received from Washington Concerning this work. To these I have added data from the 1930 consue report showing numbers and locations of North Carolina's population of Greek birth or descent. My personal impression in that this ethnie group has largely increased in numbers since 1930.</p>
    <p>Please read these instructions carefully and prepare to carry them out as quickly and effectively as possible. For this purpose I advise you to place one of the best workers in your district in charge of the work involved. This worker should first of all look for helpful contacts among the more intelligent and influential Greeks of the district. Such help should not be hard to obtain in view of the fact that the study is sponsored by the Federation of Learned Greek Societies and has the support of the Greek Orthodox Church in America. Free these sources we may also expect to get names of leading Greeks in various localities within the state.</p>
    <p>The next Step should take the form of general rather than detailed study of Greek colonies, institutions, and organizations within the district-localities containing a large number of the race, churches, schools, societies, clubs, etc. The information thus obtained can then be made the basis for the detailed inquiries outlined in the instructions. And all the time these engaged in this study must bear in mind the absolute necessity of authenticating all information received by exact recording of its sources. This requirement was largely disregarded during the collection of field material for the State Guide, and the results of this negligence were such that a repetition of it cannot be permitted.</p>
    <p>I am afraid that we may not count on finding much printed material bearing on this study but the possibility of its existence - in the form of newspaper articles, for instance- must not be overlooked. On the other hand, it is quite likely that manuscript material nay be found among the persons to whom we are to look for help, and no effort should be spared to discover and get access to such material.</p>
    <p>As only a limited numbers of workers can be assigned to this task, and as the widely scattered location of the element concerned would make the task a difficult one under any circumstances, I must once more emphasize the need of obtaining all possible assistances from representative and reliable members of the element in question - always remembering that even the best sources of information must be checked and double-checked.</p>
    <p>All material collected in the course of this work must be forwarded to the State Director, and not directly to Washington. Reports on steps taken to prepare the work and on subsequent progress made must be submitted at brief intervals. The present general directions will be followed by more detailed ones as reports are received on the preliminary surveys in the several districts.</p>

    <p>Dear Mr. Bjorkman:						Re: Greek Study</p>
    <p>Thanks for the material which you sent in care of the New York office on June 6th. I have gone over it and enjoyed reading the two personal histories, I shan't go into details now as I shall wait for more material and then let the Greek sponsoring committee go over it. In the first story, (on Gaston County) you have given us some interesting material on the local organization and the mountain resort. In the first personal history, (Hellas in America) we don't get the locality in Turkey, just Turkey, which, of course, is much too general. On pages 6 ff, where work is referred to, it would be interesting to know something about what work he did in the mill, conditions as compared to his work in Greece, etc., how he got along at his job and with his fellow workers. The same goes for the next job in Pittsburgh. The story, it strikes me, is somewhat Horatio Algier in tone - no doubt the boy did make good, but there is little on what we would like to know, as the whole problem of adjustment, etc.</p>
    <p>The second personal history (Why So Many Greek Restaurants?), has the same general tone We really don't know much about the man once he lands in this country - at his adjustment to local conditions, his relations in the community, etc., But both stories are a good beginning. What we want now is a bit more of the lowdown. It' s all right for Pete (both Petes) to feel themselves pretty good fellows and tell that sort of a story, but both have a lot more to tell that you will probably have to drag out by the teeth.</p>
    <p>In going over the memorandum of June 7, 1939, sent to your supervisors in connection with the Greek Study, I notice that you refer to the scattered nature of the Greek element in the State and the need therefore of getting all possible aid from reliable members of the Greek people in the State. This is true. I should have stressed this in my covering letter. The Greek sponsors had agreed that our State staffs could not possibly cover the situation in detail, without full cooperation of the Greek community leaders, etc. By cooperation we mean actual gathering of data, as well as giving life histories, etc; also gathering material for us from press and other printed matters. The job of our staffs, on the whole, is, as you point out, largely a matter of checking and couble-checking data submitted to our staff members - aside from personal histories gathered by our staff which may give a cross-sectional view of Greeks in your State, or in any given State. In case this cooperation is not forthcoming, please press the point on the leaders of the Greek community, and, if necessary, write to me and I shall forward your statement to the Greek sponsors and the Archbishoptic. I don't imagine you will have much difficulty, as the Greeks are eager to get out a volume.</p>
    <p>One point might be stressed here, namely that most attention should be devoted to the common run of Greeks - rather than to those who happened to get beyond that status. There is a natural tendency on the part of immigrant peoples to play up the few who have "made good," as against the rank and file workers, etc. Our story, of course, is not an Algier tale of boys who made good but a story of the Greek people in this country - the work they do, the life they lead, etc.etc., and their adjustments in the general community.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>

    <p>Take a pound of unsalted butter. Melt it over a low fire. Take a saucer full of powder sugar ( or about a large cooking spoon of sugar. ) Beat it into the butter. You will have to work hard, if you want to make it good. Beat it either with the hands or with an egg beater for about a half hour. Add a tablespoon of orange juice. Beat this in gradually for 15 minutes. Now put in one-half teaspoonful of soda. Work this in for about two minutes. Sift a sifter full of flour very fine. Work the flour in with the hands until the dough is thick and has lost the odor of flour. Pat or roll dough on board and cut into different shapes,-diamonds, hearts, stars, half moons, etc.</p>
    <p>Bake in oven at 350 degrees. If the test cooky burns on the bottom, place a pan of water in the bottom of the oven.</p>
    <p>Brown nicely, do not burn. Dip in powdered sugar while hot.</p>
