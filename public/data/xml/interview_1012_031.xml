    <p>THEODORE HATZOPULOS (&amp;lt;text not clear&amp;gt;-op-u-los</p>
    <p>142 Northwest 13th, Avenue</p>
    <p>Miami, Florida.</p>
    <p>Mr. Hatzopulos, age 60, is a very active, energetic, heavy set man. He is slightly bald, wears glasses and speaks with a distinctive guttural Greek accent. He is very friendly and became so interested in my interview and the things that I have done for the Greek people, that, although he was chief cook and server in his restaurant, he would come out of his kitchen between orders to offer bits of information that would come to his mind.</p>
    <p>At different times he called some of his regular boarders to my &amp;lt;text not clear&amp;gt; and proudly introduced then to me. Once he served me a large bowl of soup while taking a cup of coffee at my table, in order to toll me more about the official church relations of the ones whom I had not.</p>

    <p>CHRISTIAN PAPA DEMERTRY</p>
    <p>Christian Papa Demetry, ago about 50, is a fine intelligent man, the son of a priest who gave him every opportunity to get a good education. When I stated the purpose of my visit and mentioned that I wanted to make a collection of various superstitions that he might know that night have been caused by, best stories or myths, he remarked that as a child he was very superstitious. It seemed that his grandmother's strange stories had a fearful effect on him, although he could not remember the stories any longer.</p>
    <p>"When my dad used to send me out of doors after anything. If it was getting dark, every step of the ay. I used to see a dog ahead of me. I was &amp;lt;text not clear&amp;gt; so much. I'd keep saying: 'Go on! Co away! Co away, dog! 'but the dog wouldn't move. Then &amp;lt;text not clear&amp;gt;I'd get where the dog had been, or where I thought it was, there would be no dog there, but I'd see it &amp;lt;text not clear&amp;gt; of me, looking right at me. Oh! I'd be so afraid. &amp;lt;text not clear&amp;gt; know now it was all imagination, but I'll never for &amp;lt;text not clear&amp;gt; how I was afraid to go out doors alone.</p>
    <p>"One summer when school closed, I thought I'd go ever &amp;lt;text not clear&amp;gt; and earn some money in the tobacco fields. We had to blade the leaves early in the morning &amp;lt;text not clear&amp;gt; the dew was on the leaves between four o'clock and Sunrise. I worked one day, but the next day, I thought I'd go real early child it was still almost dare.</p>
    <p>"When I got there, I saw the Devil dancing and prancing around ever the field. He kept just about 100 feet away from me. It was the real Devil, just a I had always seen his pictures, - horns, tail and all. I was so afraid that I didn't know what to do.</p>
    <p>"I ran back, to the house, but I didn't want to tell the folks that I saw, for I know they would laugh at &amp;lt;text not clear&amp;gt; that I just saw some alive &amp;lt;text not clear&amp;gt; having of &amp;lt;text not clear&amp;gt; like that. So when it was &amp;lt;text not clear&amp;gt;I went out there and looked around, but I couldn't see anything that night have fooled me. No one could make me stay there say longer. I ran off and never told them where I was going.</p>
    <p>"As I had to cross creeks, I went barefooted, running as fast as I could go. I was afraid to look around. I thought somebody or the Devil was throwing stones at me. I couldn't look around for fear of seeing him again.</p>
    <p>"When I reached home I was sick in bed for three days. There was nothing wrong with so but fear, I think all there stories of supposition com from fear."</p>
