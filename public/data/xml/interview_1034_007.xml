    <p>Famous Greek Americans</p>
    <p>Dr. George Patterson, the most famous Greek ever to reside in Wilmington, was born in this country in 1828 of a Greek father and an American mother. His father, George Pappatharakies, adopted his wife's name, Patterson, for himself and son.</p>
    <p>Dr. Patterson, or Father Patterson as he was known to hundreds, was a scholar and very popular with all classes of people in Wilmington. He was equally at home in the mansions of the wealthy or the cottages of the poor. He advocated the celibacy of the clergy and himself never married. He served as chaplain of the Third North Carolina Regiment during the War Between the States.</p>
    <p>Dr. Patterson's memory is revered for his many acts of charity and also remembered for his eccentricities. With typical Greek thrift, he saved his parish a large sum of money when he planned and built the first rectory of that church. He lived there alone except for a colored waiter. He would often go into saloons and drink unhesitatingly with the men at the bar, and then he would say, "Well, gentlemen, I have done what you asked me to do, and now I would like to ask you to do something for me." Then he would ask the men to kneel that he might pray for their souls. The story goes that not one man ever failed to kneel for his blessing.</p>
    <p>He died in Memphis, Tennessee in 1901. Soon afterwards, a stained glass window, donated by popular subscription, was placed in Saint John's Episcopal Church in Wilmington of which he was rector for many years, and it bore this inscription: "Faithful soldier and servant unto his life's end."</p>
