    <p>John Popa john, forty-eight years of age, has been in the United States since 1905. He was born near Sparta, Greece, where his father was a farmer. He came over here with his uncle who was seeking his fortune. John's father did not object to his son stopping school, for he felt that money and security meant more than an education. He was illiterate himself.</p>
    <p>John and his uncle went directly to Milwaukee where they both found employment in a cigar store. Later he worked in a billiard parlor, then he went back to the cigar store. He traveled extensively, working in each town he came to and looking for a place to settle permanently.</p>
    <p>John spent two weeks in Raleigh in 1912, but he seemed unable to decide that this was the ideal place to settle. He returned in 1925 and worked until 1927, then he was off again to find a better place. In 1933 he returned and opened a lunch room which he soon lost. Since that time he has worked at different lunch rooms all over town. He is now employed in a grade B lunch room owned by his son-in-law, but he is still thinking of an ideal place. He likes Raleigh, but it is not the Utopia he imagined.</p>
    <p>His father sent him a bride from Greece in 1915. They have only one child, a girl, who was educated in the public schools of this country. She married an American Greek, and they have one child.</p>
    <p>John has not received his citizenship papers yet, although he has applied for them three different times. The first time he applied he was informed that a fire on Ellis Island destroyed the record of his landing. He tried again, but that time was unable to read the Constitution. He now hopes to get his papers within thirty days.</p>
    <p>John believes in quiet and privacy, so there are only five people occupying the seven-room house in which he lives. Nearly all of the local Greeks live in crowded apartments. John says, "A house full of voices is a house with little thought."</p>
