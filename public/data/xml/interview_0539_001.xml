    <p>BAD BARGAINS ARE SOMETIMES GOOD </p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>t&amp;gt;&amp;gt; </p>
    <p>Jr* </p>
    <p>I am separated from my husband on the account of my dead daughter's diary. She left it locked in her trunk when she </p>
    <p>went to the hospital and made me promise never to let human eyes see it. She didn't tell me what to do with ^ it if she </p>
    <p>died and so I just left it where she had it. I should have buried it with her and that would have saved my home </p>
    <p>perhaps, but I doubt it because she had kept us together for seven years before her death* </p>
    <p>' She had been dead only two months when Dave broke the lock and read the diary. The first I knew of it he was </p>
    <p>holding the little red-backed book out to me, his face dark with rage. ne told me to read a certain paragraph and as I </p>
    <p>read I relived a certain short chapter in my own life. She told a story both beautiful and sordid of her love for a man </p>
    <p>whom her father detested. She went on to tell of their stolen hours together and of her bliss when he at last proposed. </p>
    <p>He persuaded her to go with him to the mountains where he said they would be married. After they reached the </p>
    <p>beautiful little inn on Lake Lure, John told her that marriage would kill their </p>
    <p>715*8 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>-2- </p>
    <p>love, and he persuaded her to stay with him there for a week. The description of the scenery was beautifully expressed, </p>
    <p>but in every word one could read her heartbreak, I wept as I read and Dave cursed me for my folly in letting her go on </p>
    <p>that trip which was supposed to be a visit to a girl friend in another city. I read on, paying no attention to his curses </p>
    <p>and I saw that all of the neighborhood gossip, or nearly all of it, was true. She had been too intimate with a number of </p>
    <p>men. Her life was ruined when John did her wrong, and soon after that she began the practice that ruined her life and </p>
    <p>sent her to her grave at the age of seventeen. She had married a year before her death, but her diary told of her hate for </p>
    <p>her husband and that she married him for spite. I had TB and spent most of my time in bed, and I had thought that she </p>
    <p>wouldn't live with him since she relt that she had to stay </p>
    <p>with me. I learned the truth from the little red book. </p>
    <p>I! </p>
    <p>She still worshiped John and she said that she didn't </p>
    <p>care what happened now as she had learned that he did not love her. She literally threw her life away. A few months </p>
    <p>before she went to the hospital, our family doctor found out that she had TB and ordered her to bed. She changed some </p>
    <p>then-let cigarettes and beer alone and often read the Bible. \he told of her despair and her hopes of leaving the </p>
    <p>earth} ^n the last pages of her diary,/ and she expressed the hope that John </p>
    <p>715)9 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>-3- </p>
    <p>would come to her burial. He did come and brought a huge heart of lilies, and he told, me that she was as pure as the </p>
    <p>flowers he brought, ^e talked to me as if he were my son, and he cried and told me how he loved her. </p>
    <p>When I finished reading the diary I threw it in the fire and I held on to Dave with every ounce of strength I had to </p>
    <p>keep him from retrieving it. It burned to ashes while he cursed and I looked calmly at him. I heard him say that my </p>
    <p>child had relived my own life over again. He said that I had no need to be angry or hurt. I just looked at him and said </p>
    <p>nothing, but I was hurt because she hadn't justified my faith in her. I reflected that I hadn't justified my mother's faith </p>
    <p>in me either, but that made the pain no less. I had worshiped my daughter, and I thought her pure in everything. She </p>
    <p>had tried to copy Mae West and Jean Harlow, and she had favored Jean and Mae a great deal with her golden hair, </p>
    <p>blue eyes, and perfect figure. She picked up their ways and words, too, and I hadn't objected because I thought it was </p>
    <p>so becoming to </p>
    <p>her. </p>
    <p>// </p>
    <p>Her father was a tall handsome blond with a way </p>
    <p>about him. I was teaching a little school here at the time </p>
    <p>I fell in love with him. He said that he loved me, too, and </p>
    <p>we were engaged. One day my father came in and told me that </p>
    <p>a girl in a nearby town was going to have a baby for him. I </p>
    <p>7200 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>-4- </p>
    <p>didnTt believe it, and I asked him about it. He vowed that he didn't know the girl, but Father forbid me ever seeing him </p>
    <p>again. He said that he had heard others say things about him, too. He claimed that all the world was unfair to him and </p>
    <p>he persuaded me to go away and marry him. It was the same old story-lived together for a month without any </p>
    <p>ceremony at all. He left after that and when my daughter was born I was all alone. I told my mother the truth and she </p>
    <p>stuck to me, but Father told me that I must leave his nouse. Mother sent me what money she could get out of cnickens </p>
    <p>and. eggs ana that helped a lot. When the baby was three montns old I went back </p>
    <p>to teaching but not here; they wouldn't hire me again. </p>
    <p>// I met and. loved Dave when she was a little over a </p>
    <p>year old; I told him the truth, but he married me just the </p>
    <p>same. I can't say that he loved me, though, because he let me </p>
    <p>work for him while he loafed and drank. I taught school and </p>
    <p>supported the family while he pretended to hold a job as a </p>
    <p>printer. He was a good printer and he made good, wages, but </p>
    <p>he so often wouldn't work and when he did he spent what he made </p>
    <p>on foolishness. If I reproved him he always reminded me that I </p>
    <p>was lucky to get anyone to have me, even ir I did have to work </p>
    <p>for him. </p>
    <p>i</p>
    <p>We had been married a little over a year when a boy was born. I had no money for hospital or nurse to stay at </p>
    <p>7201 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>home with me, so I suffered for the lack or attention. Dave was proud or his son but not proud enough to work and </p>
    <p>support him. As soon as I was up again I got a school and began teaching, hiring a colored girl to stay with the </p>
    <p>children. She didn't take very good care or them and I changed again and again. Dave stayed at home most of the time, </p>
    <p>but he declined the responsibility of taking care 01 the children. </p>
    <p>We had been married three years when I got on at the printers as a proof reader and a lew weeks after I got on there </p>
    <p>Dave got sick and the doctor said that he had Tb. I had him a sleeping porch built and kept him in the bed while I </p>
    <p>worked and paid the bills. He was too ill to look after the children at all, out when he took a notion that he wanted a </p>
    <p>drink he wasn't too ill to walk out to the bootleggers' and get it. I'd often find him dead drunk when I came home from </p>
    <p>a hard day </p>
    <p>in the office. </p>
    <p>I) When the boy was two years old Jean was born. I </p>
    <p>had managed to save enough to go to the hospital that time, </p>
    <p>but one evening when I came rrom work I found Dave gone and </p>
    <p>my money gone, too. When he got home two days later he had </p>
    <p>an old piece or a car and two gallons of whiskey. He told </p>
    <p>me with a grand touch of defiance that when a couple was </p>
    <p>married what belonged to one belonged to both and that he </p>
    <p>has as nuch right to the money as I had. He also said that </p>
    <p>I ought to be eternally grateful that he married me. I said </p>
    <p>7^02 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>nothing to him, but I cried and cried in secret. So when she was born I had an old Negro midwife and no doctor or </p>
    <p>nurse at all. </p>
    <p>// </p>
    <p>The boss was kind, and when Jean was three weeks </p>
    <p>old I went back to work. He advised me never to have any </p>
    <p>more children, and he told me what doctor to visit to get </p>
    <p>the information I needed. I did as he said and ? never had </p>
    <p>another. </p>
    <p>When Jean was five years old I had a nervous </p>
    <p>break-down and soon I learned that I had TB. Dave told the </p>
    <p>doctor that we would all have to depend on charity to keep </p>
    <p>us up, but the doctor told him that he was now able to work if </p>
    <p>he could get an outdoor job. He did arrange ror me to go </p>
    <p>to the Sanatorium on charity, though. My children went to </p>
    <p>stay with my mother and that left Dave on his own. I heard </p>
    <p>that he tried to get on charity, but a man he appealed to </p>
    <p>got him a job as a guard at the prison rarm. </p>
    <p>1/ When I got out or the Sanatorium, Dave got a house </p>
    <p>on the farm and moved us to it, and he worked for us from </p>
    <p>then on until three years ago. He hated it, though, and he </p>
    <p>often talked of what a burden we were to him. He especially </p>
    <p>hated my daughter and once in a fit of rage he told her that </p>
    <p>he was not her father. She only smiled and told him that she </p>
    <p>was delighted that he was not. She told me then that she </p>
    <p>didn't care a thing about it. !f I had been married before </p>
    <p>7203 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>-7- </p>
    <p>and wished to keep it a secret she didn't care. If I hadn't been married before she still didn't care, just so Dave wasn't </p>
    <p>her rather. I never did tell her and she never asked me again, but I think that she knew the truth. Dave told her </p>
    <p>afterwards that he was only fooling, that she was his as much as the other </p>
    <p>girl and boy. </p>
    <p>// </p>
    <p>/ She had a hard lire rrom the first she could remember, </p>
    <p>but she had the stuff it takes to do things. She was ambitious, </p>
    <p>sensitive, and sympathetic. She had high ideals and a poetic </p>
    <p>nature that made her reel things more deeply than the ordinary </p>
    <p>person would feel them. She had to look after the younger </p>
    <p>children when she was just a little tot, and I was ill for </p>
    <p>the last nine years she lived and she had to do the cooking, </p>
    <p>washing, scrubbing, and house cleaning besides looking after </p>
    <p>the two younger ones and waiting on me. Dave fussed with her </p>
    <p>on the slightest provocation and from the time she was twelve </p>
    <p>he woulu accuse ner 01 every conceivable thing. Poor child, </p>
    <p>she simply had to get hardened. She missed few days in school, </p>
    <p>though, and she finished high school at the age or sixteen. I </p>
    <p>had hoped that she could go to college but she simply couldn't </p>
    <p>make it. </p>
    <p>// </p>
    <p>She got a job on the ERA before she died and did </p>
    <p>clerical work two days a week. She had to catch rides or walk the seven miles to town for that work, but she never </p>
    <p>7204 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>missed being there regardless of the weather. She didn't make much, but she bought her own clothes and she took out </p>
    <p>an insurance policy on herself which buried her. I think that sne knew then that her days were few. </p>
    <p>For several years she had been keeping Dave and I together by using a lot of tact and smoothing over the rough places </p>
    <p>for us both. If we started quarreling she'd try to stop us by explaining or by changing the subject. That child bore </p>
    <p>troubles that would have killed an ordinary person. Even when her father Degan having affairs with a common sort of </p>
    <p>woman close by us, she nad to bear the burden herseli. They would write notes to each other and send them by </p>
    <p>prisoners. The prisoners woflLLd give them to her arter they round out that she found one they had lost. They could </p>
    <p>have gotten into some serious trouble about it, but somehow they didn't. They gave her the notes and she kept them </p>
    <p>hidden. She told Dave that she had them and once he tried to beat her and make her tell where they were, out she </p>
    <p>wouldn't. She blackmailed him to force him to be Kinder to me, but, at last, I found one or her notes in his pocket. </p>
    <p>Dave had been better to me since he learned that she had the notes but she was careful not to let me know it. One day I </p>
    <p>found a note in his pocket and I confronted him with it. That was how I found out that she had the letters. He </p>
    <p/>
    <p>9- </p>
    <p>spoke up and saia that she had given me the notes. I then tola him where I got it ana ne triea to make out like he w as </p>
    <p>joking about it. He slapped me, though, ior searcning nis pockets, and then she waikea in ana toiu mm that she still naa </p>
    <p>the letters ana tnat sne was going to snow tnem to me and to the woman's husband. He ordered ner to bring them out, </p>
    <p>but she knew wnat his intentions were. So she waitea until he went to work berore sne snowea them to me. </p>
    <p>Never in my whole life have I ever seen such vulgar things written. She told him that her youngest baby was his and </p>
    <p>that she felt sure that he knew this. She mentioned a rumor or her having a date with a prisoner and denied it bitterly. </p>
    <p>She begged him to meet her in the cornfield at certain periods and she also mentioned a certain house in town where </p>
    <p>they occasionally met. </p>
    <p>I could have gone to her husband, but I preferred that he be kept in ignorance as long as possible. I had a hard time </p>
    <p>restraining my daughter then. She seemed determined that the husband should know. When I pointed out that that </p>
    <p>might be the best way of separating them and thus giving her to Dave she saw that I was right, but she went to the </p>
    <p>supervisor of the farm and told him the story. Both Dave and the woman's husband worked there, and she begged the </p>
    <p>supervisor to transfer one or the other. He tola her that </p>
    <p>7206 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>-10- </p>
    <p>he had heard that this woman was selling whiskey and demoralizing the prisoners. He wanted to get rid of her ana that </p>
    <p>he would transfer her husband at once. </p>
    <p>' He did transfer the husband to another camp but his wife refused to move. She stayed on at the house and Dave </p>
    <p>openly spent nights with her. My daughter went back to the supervisor, and he ordered the woman to move. She </p>
    <p>refused and then my daughter went to the Welfare Department and reported that Dave wasn't supporting us-our bills </p>
    <p>were away behind and Dave showed no inclination to pay them. He bought this woman a lovely new spring outfit and </p>
    <p>gave her a ten dollar bill in public. The welfare officer put a stop to that, though, by telling him that he would go to jail </p>
    <p>if he didn't pay the bills and buy some groceries within the next few days. The supervisor went to her and ordered her </p>
    <p>to move within a few days or he would have her thrown out, and he also told Dave that unless he gave that woman up, </p>
    <p>stopped drinking, and began to take care of his family better he would fire him at once. She was furious but she </p>
    <p>moved, and Dave was in a towering rage for several weeks. He accused my daughter of doing all the mischief, but had </p>
    <p>he known for sure that she did he would have beaten her. I begged her to keep the secret and let him think what he </p>
    <p>pleased. </p>
    <p>7207 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>-11- </p>
    <p>// </p>
    <p>I should have left him during his affair with that woman, but I loved him and felt too dependent on him. But when I </p>
    <p>heard him defaming my dead child I picked up and left in a few minutes. I told him that I was never going to live with </p>
    <p>him again and that the children shouldn't claim him for their father. I left in spite of his pleas. At last, he </p>
    <p>said that it was good riddance and let us go. </p>
    <p>// </p>
    <p>After we left him, he stayed drunk and ran around </p>
    <p>with bad women, neglecting his job for vice. He got fired and for a short time he had no work at all and lived on </p>
    <p>anyone who would give him a meal and a shelter to sleep under. Two years ago he got on with the Government. He </p>
    <p>didn't make much but he could live on it, and all tne time he was pleading with me to come back to him and writing </p>
    <p>me letters, telling me how much he missed us and how much he loved us. </p>
    <p>At first I didn't answer the letters, and when he came I refused to see him or let the children see him. I heard from </p>
    <p>several sources how hard he worked and how he had quit drinking; I heard that he was not interested in other women </p>
    <p>any more and that he was going to church every Sunday, so I finally made up my mind that if he would prove himself I </p>
    <p>would go back to him. I wrote and asked him to come to see us. , </p>
    <p>I found that he had changed as much as rumor said </p>
    <p>he had. e made love to me like he used to do when I was </p>
    <p>7208 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>-12* </p>
    <p>little more than a child, and he promised to care for me if I would give him a chance. He admitted that he had been at </p>
    <p>fault all the way, and he also admitted that I had broken my health to take care of him while he was ill. He says that he </p>
    <p>feels that the rest of his life will not be long enough for him to make it up to me. I hope that feeling will last the rest of </p>
    <p>his life. </p>
    <p>I write to him once a week now and he writes to me once a week. He sends me half of the money he makes and I am </p>
    <p>proud that I can put it up and not spend it. You see, I sew well and in the Sanatorium I learned how to make fancy </p>
    <p>bags, beads, hats, and a lot of other things. I make these and sell them here in the neighborhood and send the surplus </p>
    <p>to town. I take in sewing for my neighbors and, as the house is mine, we don't have to pay rent, so we managp pretty </p>
    <p>well. I even put away a little of my income sometimes. Ihe boy works at a local store and makes $10 a week and his </p>
    <p>lunch. He gives me $5 a week, and I make about $8 or $10 a week. </p>
    <p>He finished high school last year and is hoping to go to college next fall. He is going to try to save a little on toward it </p>
    <p>and then get in so he can work his way through. Jean is in the tenth grade this year and I hope that she will finish next </p>
    <p>year and get an opportunity to go to college the next. I would like for both of my children </p>
    <p>TM3 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>-13- </p>
    <p>tto attend the college where I once graduated with great pride. My parents were proud, too, but our pride came before </p>
    <p>our fall. </p>
    <p>We had nothing but the little farm here when I finished high school and announced that I would like to go to college. I </p>
    <p>begged Dad to do something about my ambitions and he did. He mortgaged the farm to borrow money for my </p>
    <p>education and he hoped that I would pay it back. I did pay part of it, but my daughter was born ana I had all I could </p>
    <p>do to keep body and soul together. After I married I had a family to support and nothing over at all. I dressed neatly </p>
    <p>but cheaply, and I never had a cent to pay on bills made </p>
    <p>before my marriage. </p>
    <p>// </p>
    <p>Before I left home Dad saw to it that I had nice </p>
    <p>clothes, but he made no distinction between my two sisters </p>
    <p>and myself. He dressed us equally well, but when they got </p>
    <p>ready ror college he protested that college probably had a </p>
    <p>great deal to do with my downfall and that he was through </p>
    <p>with education for life. He resented the fact that they </p>
    <p>wanted to go to high school, but Mama insisted that they be </p>
    <p>allowed to go. She sent them in spite of his dislike for </p>
    <p>it, and she dressed them neatly in spite of the fact that he </p>
    <p>gave her very little to dress them on. He told her that they </p>
    <p>ought to be satisfied to be country girls and not try to do a </p>
    <p/>
    <p>-14- </p>
    <p>thing but stay at home and get married to some farm boy that </p>
    <p>they had known all their lives, </p>
    <p>H He gave me permission but reminded me that the Bible </p>
    <p>said to rorgive seventy times seventy and that he had forgiven </p>
    <p>me already more than that. He treated me nice but showed no </p>
    <p>interest in me at all. I left the baby with her nurse because </p>
    <p>I felt sure that he would not care to see her. When I started </p>
    <p>to go Mama wanted me to stay over the week-end, but I told her </p>
    <p>that I could not leave the baby that long. She told me to go </p>
    <p>back home and get her and come back. </p>
    <p>a</p>
    <p>Dad got interested in her because she seemed so fond of him from the start, ^he would play with him and try to get on </p>
    <p>his lap, and she tried her best to say "Grandpa." He loved her like his own before time to go and from then on we were </p>
    <p>welcome visitors there. He sometimes kept her for a week at the time, When the boy was born he was delighted, but </p>
    <p>he loved frail little Jean the best of all. She was the most like him with her big brown eyes, dark skin, and brown hair. </p>
    <p>She had slender ringers, too, which Dad thought meant that she would be an expert musician. Dave and Jean look </p>
    <p>much alike, and it's no wonder that my other daughter's fair beauty caused Dave to hate. her. Everything about her </p>
    <p>reminded him tnat she was not his. I guess it preyed on his mind, and I can't find it in my heart to blame him much. </p>
    <p>7211 </p>
    <p/>
    <p>-15- </p>
    <p>' Mother taught me a lot about life. She told me all </p>
    <p>the secrets of love ana she taught me about child-bearing. </p>
    <p>She told me much about the beauty of nature and one of her </p>
    <p>favorite sayings was, "Blessed are the merciful." She taught </p>
    <p>me to love all of life and to think it pure and sweet. I </p>
    <p>learned the birds and the little animals at an early age, and </p>
    <p>I also learned about domestic animals and fowls. I studied </p>
    <p>wood lore with her, and I loved the study. Together we read </p>
    <p>poetry and philosophy, travels, ana lives of great people. We </p>
    <p>both loved the Bible ana we often studied the mystery of the </p>
    <p>parables, the beautiful simplicity of the beatitudes, and </p>
    <p>we found much pleasure in singing hymns ana love songs. I </p>
    <p>worked in house and field and went to school, but I lived a </p>
    <p>dreamy sort of life. I) Mother taught me not to gossip ana not to juage. She </p>
    <p>said that a person always {Judged others by himself ana she </p>
    <p>taught me that for every little wrong one aid he must pay </p>
    <p>double. She saia tnat conscience was the worst devil one had </p>
    <p>to meet and that we must all meet him. </p>
    <p>" Dad preached a stern philosophy. He said that we </p>
    <p>would pay here ana hereafter, too, and that we would pay a </p>
    <p>XT </p>
    <p>thousandfold for each little wrong. ae preached hell fire </p>
    <p>and the anger or a just God. There was very little room for </p>
    <p>love in his life except his love for my mother, and sometimes </p>
    <p>she could not even dent his hard shell. </p>

    <p>He belonged to the Free Will Baptist and Mother to the Missionary Baptist. I joined her church and we ail tried to </p>
    <p>discuss our beliefs with each other and get to the bottom of things. Dad was sternly just but very unreasonable about </p>
    <p>some things that he had always believed in. He would hear no talk of a heaven unless the speaker brought in nell as </p>
    <p>well. He would have no talk of cheating at cards not gambling for any stake, and. he called fairs and shows tne devil's </p>
    <p>playhouse. I got most of my ideas from ^ama. but sometimes I remembered </p>
    <p>Dad's talks with a shudder. </p>
    <p>// </p>
    <p>My daughter took her thoughts from me just like I </p>
    <p>did from my mother. She loved me just as I loved my mother, </p>
    <p>and she believed in the Missionary Baptist, too. My dad was </p>
    <p>a Democrat, though, and -1- followed in his footsteps as soon </p>
    <p>as women were allowed to vote. If ^ama had been Republican I </p>
    <p>would have voted her way, though, I'm sure. </p>
    <p>// </p>
    <p>I never was used to anything but poverty and I </p>
    <p>wouldn't know how to act if I were to suddenly get rich. Mama </p>
    <p>and *apa had a modest income from the farm but we raised what </p>
    <p>we needed at home. Our forty acres supplied all the foodstuff </p>
    <p>we could use and we had enough money crop to buy clothes and </p>
    <p>the extra things we needed. We seldom borrowed and seldom </p>
    <p>loaned, but we often red the hungry and helped the sick. </p>

    <p>-17- </p>
    <p>ll The people in our neighborhood practiced helping </p>
    <p>their neighbors. They would, sit up with the sick, cut wood </p>
    <p>for them, and attend to their work almost as well as the </p>
    <p>owner himself would. I can remember once when Dad was sick </p>
    <p>the neighbors did nearly all of the work for us for over a </p>
    <p>month. Few people would be willing to do that now. </p>
    <p>" My county has the reputation of being one or the </p>
    <p>most ignorant and superstitious in the state. My family </p>
    <p>and my neighbors certainly were not superstitious and they </p>
    <p>were not ignorant either. They all had some education and </p>
    <p>most of them had the equivalent or a high school education </p>
    <p>now. </p>
    <p>H After -1- was married we had very little, and since </p>
    <p>Dave and I parted there have been some bad times. I inherited </p>
    <p>this home from my mama when she died four years ago, and it </p>
    <p>surely proved a refuge in my time of trouble. If I hadn't </p>
    <p>had this place I don't know what I would have done. I've </p>
    <p>thought it over, though, and I've come to the conclusion that </p>
    <p>sometimes a bad bargain aoes more for a person than a good one. </p>
    <p>Now, if 1 had married a good man -1 would never have learned </p>
    <p>that ^ could support myself under these circumstances. I </p>
    <p>would never have Known how to appreciate a good man like I </p>
    <p>appreciate Dave now. </p>

    <p>'We have poor funiture, as you see, but it is all A </p>
    <p>ours. Dave never bought a piece or furniture in his lire. I bought some or this when we were nrst married. That old </p>
    <p>brown dresser there and the bed to match are two pieces of it, and the old wood stove and the old table in the kitchen </p>
    <p>are two more. The wardrobe in the boy's bedroom, he made of old timber, and the dressing table I made with three </p>
    <p>orange crates and some cretonne. My son made the bookcase, too, and there's nothing in it but old orange crates. That </p>
    <p>easy chair is made from a barrel. Wm had two of them but one gave out. He built the pantry shelves and the cabinet </p>
    <p>in the kitchen and he rebuilt the old safe in the kitchen. It was a hard job for a boy, but he learned how to do a lot of it </p>
    <p>in school last year and I taught him what I knew. I think that the jars and cans he painted ror vases are lovely, and I </p>
    <p>made the flowers that are in them. </p>
    <p>The children want me to go back to their daddy, and if he can go on for a little while longer saving and not drinking </p>
    <p>and he can get us a place to live near him I am going to move. We have $500 saved now, but i think we ought to have </p>
    <p>$1,000. It won!t take us long to do that and then we will move back with him and try to buy some new rurniture and </p>
    <p>let the boy make all he wants to as well, </p>

    <p>*</p>
    <p>I've learned a much needed lesson during this three years I've been away from my husband: That it isn't necessary to </p>
    <p>lie in the bed all the time, because I'm better now that I've been working some; that my work keeps me from being so </p>
    <p>self-centered; that my reading and my association with others makes me a more interesting companion and keeps me </p>
    <p>from talking about myself and my own ailments; that the love I have for Dave is more important than his love for me, </p>
    <p>so far as I am concerned; that a lot of our trouble was my own fault; and I've teamed to be cheerful without appearing </p>
    <p>to be just smiling and bearing it. I really am getting some pleasure out or life now. I am happy for the first time since </p>
    <p>my daughter was born. Of course, 1 remember her and feel sad that her young lire was ruined, but I remember that it </p>
    <p>had a purpose. </p>
    <p>''When Dave comes this week-end S shall try to tell him some or what I have told you, and I'm sure our broken hone </p>
    <p>will be mended soon and that we will all see that we have benefitted by a tragedy, but isn't that the way of life? One </p>
    <p>always prospers by a hurt but seldom by a good fortune. </p>
