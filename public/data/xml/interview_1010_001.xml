    <p>Miami, Florida.</p>
    <p>(Mrs.) Catina Manos</p>
    <p>761 SW 3d. Street</p>
    <p>Miami, Florida</p>
    <p>Mrs. Catina (Catherine) Manos, age 49, and her three children live in a cozy yellow frame cottage on the rear of a lot at 759 SW 3d. Street. One side of the house is shaded by a large mango tree while near the front porch entrance there is a tall coconut tree heavily loaded with fruit. Three hare rockers, a small flower stand and a corner cupboard with a mirror constitute the porch furniture.</p>
    <p>As the appointment had been made in advance, Mrs. Manos greeted me very cordially, especially since I had broken down her self- consciousness as evidenced by her remark:</p>
    <p>"Oh, me no speak English. You no could un 'crstan' me."</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes," I explained, "you spoke English. I understood every word. I am your friend. I go around and help all kinds of foreign speaking people to speak and write English. I'll come to your home and help you to talk English."</p>
    <p>At this she clasped my hand with both of hors and I road an eager appeal in her face as she said: "Aw right, you cum after 5:30. Me Mary she help you. T'ank you! T'ank you! Cum!"</p>
    <p>They had just finished their supper and were washing the dishes at a small table in the kitchen. The dining room between the large front living room and kitchen was furnished with a bed for John. There was a bathroom adjoining the kitchen and another bedroom leading from the dining room.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Manos is approximately five foot tall and weighs about 132 pounds. She is a brunette with dark eyes, and a motherly, rather careworn, expression. Her heavy black hair is parted in the middle and caught tightly into a large braid that coiled all over the back of her head. Being in her ninth year of mourning for her husband, she were a black and white polka dot voile dross and a black sweater.</p>
    <p>She called Mary, age 18, and John, age 16, into the living room, and proudly introduced them. John is in his first year of Senior High School. He was friendly and tried to help his mother answer my questions by speaking Greek to her. He is of a muscular, ever-grown build and somewhat awkward, but closely resembling the photograph of his father.</p>
    <p>In a short while he excused himself politely saying that he must go to the meeting of the Sons of Pericles which is a Greek organization for boys. In the meantime, Helen, age 14, also a brunette, slipped out to a neighbor's house to "do her homework."</p>
    <p>During the course of the interview Mrs. Manos digressed several times by saying: "Oh, I so gland you cum. You see how smart me Mary is. She grad'ate, June. Now, you got her good job."</p>
    <p>Mary has a charming form, a graceful carriage and attractive dark eyes and hair. She stands a few inches taller than her mother and, on the whole, presents an unusually radiant personality.</p>
    <p>Proudly, her mother took a framed treasure from the wall. It was Mary's "American Legion Certificate of Scholarship Award" Which she won when she graduated from Junior High School.</p>
    <p>"See! Road!" her mother urged. "that vet me Mary von!"</p>
    <p>Mary explained that the school and teachers took a vote to determine who could pass the highest on "all round activities, character, courage, service and scholarship," and the award was given by the local Harvey Seeds Post, No. 29.</p>
    <p>As her mother replaced the precious document, she came with two rewards of merit and a prize from the Gregg Publishing Company, one was a certificate for the hest legibility in writing shorthand and another was for receiving the highest grade in a theory test. While the two entitled her to the prize of a beautiful chromium inkwell and pen.</p>
    <p>"Do you expect to be the honor student this year." I asked Mary.</p>
    <p>"No, no I can't expect that, "Mary replied "but I've been on the honor roll every month. I am still working hard with my typing and shorthand because that will help me get a job. I can do 45 or 50 words a minute and I am trying hard to improve."</p>
    <p>In my effort to encourage the mother to talk more freely. I handed her a new calendar.</p>
    <p>"Oh, Morologi&amp;lt;text not clear&amp;gt;, Greek nom, Ca-lend-ar, American nom. See! Yaniaros."</p>
    <p>"Yes, Yaniaros is Greek name for January I said your name, now, you say January," I entreated, and to Mary's surprise she said it plainly.</p>
    <p>"She won't try like that for us. We don't think she will over learn to talk English," she added despairingly.</p>
    <p>"You see, day laf at me and I no lak it, "the mother retorted.</p>
    <p>"Well," explained Mary, "We can't help it. She calls a permanent wave a 'permanny wet.' How can we help but laugh?'</p>
    <p>"Oh, no, I am sure you can say permanent wave, Mrs. Manes."</p>
    <p>"Per-ma-nent." She repeated slowly, and with great effort she said "wave," and Mary chuckled.</p>
    <p>"You're the first one that ever get her to say that."</p>
    <p>In the meantime Mary had squeezed a glass of orange juice which she served as a gesture of hospitality.</p>
    <p>While admiring her mother's long braids, I asked if her hair was long enough to sit on and she pointed to my knee and then to my ankle.</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes, down here. Too much long, cut off zum. Von I vas girl in old country, me fodder, he go oud an' fin' snek' dress, (snake skin) three-four feet long. Not live snek. Snek gone oud. Look lak snek, but hollow. He eyes in snek dress.</p>

    <p>I closed the interview, but they seemed reluctant to have me leave and as they followed me out on the porch, I remarked about their beautiful Diefenbachia.</p>
    <p>"What nom" she asked and I repeated it until she could say it correctly, then I spelled it for Mary.</p>
    <p>"Mary, 'member dat," she remarked proudly.</p>
    <p>"Strange nom for flower? No?" she inquired anxiously.</p>
    <p>"Yes, I replied, "I think it is strange name for the flower. It is named after a great man who loved all kinds of flowers and made a study of them. His name was dieffenbachia which means deep brook, or deep little river."</p>
