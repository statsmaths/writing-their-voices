    <p>SILAS HARMON</p>
    <p>(Negro)</p>
    <p>1204 GREGG STREET, COLUMBIA, S.C.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>After old Uncle Silas had completed the task of raking up the leaves</p>
    <p>in my yard, I called him into the kitchen, seated him in a low chair, and</p>
    <p>gave him a cup of hot coffee. Characteristic of most old Negroes, coffee</p>
    <p>is one of Uncle Silas's chief weaknesses.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Yes, ma'am, you can keep your meat ef you'll jes' put de coffee to</p>
    <p>me."</p>
    <p/>
    <p>As his rheumatic bones began to thaw, and the aroma of coffee filled</p>
    <p>the room, his conversation waxed eloquent. He has no teeth, but he likes</p>
    <p>his "pot likker and corn bread." "My eyes is poorly, too, an' I can't see</p>
    <p>so good. I reckon a body sees enough, though, of sech sights as is goin'</p>
    <p>on dese days. Times is sho' changed. I can't git 'bout neither in cold</p>
    <p>weather, seem lak I have a misery in my legs, 'gin de frost come." </p>
    <p/>
    <p>Uncle Silas is small and stooped, weighing hardly more than a hundred</p>
    <p>pounds. In spite of infirmities, there is a sprightliness of gait and spirit</p>
    <p>and a lustre in his small black chinquapin eyes. He has an unruly gray mustache </p>
    <p>and thick gray hair. On his head he wore a shabby old felt hat. His</p>
    <p>coat and trousers, which were much too large for him, hung loosely on his</p>
    <p>emaciated old frame.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"It don't look much lak Thanksgivin', sho' don't. Well, ef people come</p>
    <p>here, an' think you got a heap, you can jes' s'prise 'em. I ain't got no</p>
    <p>better sense than to tell you de truf' 'bout everthing, for truf is my life.  </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Now, when you got your book in your hand, you ain't writin' no foolishness, </p>
    <p>but you writin' de truf, for I ain't tellin' nothin' but truf. I see</p>
    <p>your drif', you write 'bout me. Well, we here to help one 'nother, I help</p>
    <p>you an' you ha'p me. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I was born in Dutch Fork, Lexington County, South Carolina. Bred an'</p>
    <p>born, sho'. I's one of three chillun. I had two sisters: one name Patsy,</p>
    <p>one name Rosa. My daddy name Will Harmon. His marster name Harley, over in</p>
    <p>de Dreher settlement. My ma name Rosa Moore, an' de Wises in Dutch Fork was</p>
    <p>her marster and missus.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I's de only one left, though, all dead but me. An' I was de first one</p>
    <p>born, too. I's eighty-five year old.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Yes, ma'am, I been knowed through here a mighty long time. I tell you</p>
    <p>de truf, though: people here in Columbia don't know a sight 'bout me. I conducts </p>
    <p>myself quiet lak. Dey see me go 'long de street, and dey say, 'Dere go</p>
    <p>a old tramp.' Dey don't know it's Silas Harmon, a 'spectable nigger.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"My wife name Leila May Adams befo' I married her. She come from Georgia.</p>
    <p>We ain't got no chillun. She's poorly. My wife was sick seven or eight weeks</p>
    <p>in Savannah. Had tumor tuk out what weighed forty pounds.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"It's lak dis, I worked in Georgia in turpentine business for twenty-two</p>
    <p>year. Dat's where I made my wife's 'quaintance. I done a little cotton farmin'</p>
    <p>in', too. Turpentine job best job I ever had. Paid ever two weeks, twelve</p>
    <p>dollars. I made 'bout twenty-five dollars a month. When I sell de gum, I</p>
    <p>make eight dollars a barrel.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I's healthy. Ain't never been sick in my life, 'cept three days flu</p>
    <p>in Georgia. I had ten bale of cotton in de field when I tuk sick, an' I got </p>
    <p>right out in dat cotton patch an' me an' my wife pick it all. Dey all say</p>
    <p>I was sho' to die, but ol' Silas still here.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Me an' my wife was married in Georgia in her boss man's yard. Wan't</p>
    <p>married by no preacher, but de Trial Justice tied de knot.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Her boss man say: 'I don't know you, but 'pears lak you good man. You</p>
    <p>well thought of round an' 'bout. Dis gal you marry today is good gal. You</p>
    <p>treat her right, or you have to count for it. Ef you jes' half do, she'll</p>
    <p>sho' do her part.'</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"We was married on a Sunday evenin', an' we never had no great to-do or</p>
    <p>nothin', but struck right out to my house in de cotton patch. I had right</p>
    <p>good house then, three rooms an' fireplace. Dat was befo' my circumstances</p>
    <p>was 'duced so low.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"We got'right good house now; jes' two rooms, but it's a plenty for our</p>
    <p>needs. I pays a dollar and a half a week for rent. I never did have much</p>
    <p>good times. I worked all my days. I done a little bit of coon an' possum</p>
    <p>huntin', but never did b'lieve in all dis runnin' 'round. Dat didn't put</p>
    <p>nothin' in my pocket.  </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"My wife fifty-four year old, an' we been married thirty-eight year. I</p>
    <p>ain't never raise my hand to hit her in my life. I can't see no sense in</p>
    <p>people fightin', cussin', an' wranglin'. If dey gonna live dat away, dey</p>
    <p>ought to separate. An' ef day meets one 'nother on de street or at a meetin',</p>
    <p>dey can jes' say good-evenin' an' 'pear 'spectful lak.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I got me a sack of coal last night. I tuk it home an' built up a good</p>
    <p>fire, an' me an' my wife set back an' didn't study 'bout nothin'; kinfolks,</p>
    <p>neighbors or nothin'. You know I told My wife las' night, little as you know,</p>
    <p>we quietest family 'round here. Look lak dese others fights, gits drunk, out</p>
    <p>up, an' even go out dere on de highway an' gives deyselves 'way. I ain' t </p>
    <p>'sactly onneighbotly wid folks here 'bout, but jes' quiet an' shut-moufed.</p>
    <p>I totes myself in such a way dey all puts a linen (lenient} hand towards me,</p>
    <p>'cause I don't harm nobody.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Rather to have a han'ful of good friends than a bag full what ain't no</p>
    <p>good. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I stayed in Georgia twenty-two year. Pa died while I was livin' in</p>
    <p>Georgia. Ma died after I come back. Pa use to say: 'Son, ef you needs</p>
    <p>anything, beg for it, don't never steal.' I say, ef God 'tend for me to have</p>
    <p>anything, I has it; ef he don't, then I does widout. </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I ain't never been in a lawsuit, trouble, or jail. I'll be hones',</p>
    <p>though, I come from Georgia to see my ma, 'cause she was feeble. An' dat man</p>
    <p>we worked for in Georgia, he come over here an' had us 'rested. You know how</p>
    <p>some people is, low-principle an' do anything. He had us 'rested by de high</p>
    <p>sheriff, an' de sheriff say: 'Tell me what is dese people done? Does you know</p>
    <p>dis is Silas Harmon, bred an' born here 'mongst us? I's a mind to have you</p>
    <p>looked up. An' de sooner you gits back to Georgia de healthier it will be for</p>
    <p>you.' But dis man was tough, an' wagged a bitter tongue. An' de sheriff say</p>
    <p>he reckon he have to 'bide by de law. An' bad as he hate to do it, 'dey lock</p>
    <p>us up. But us jes' stayed in jail 'til de sheriff do some tall 'vestigatin';</p>
    <p>an' in 'bout four hours us was out.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"You see it was lak dis. he claim we s'pose to stay dere an' work for</p>
    <p>him, an' dat we come off unbeknowin's to him. I say: 'Course we aim to go</p>
    <p>back. Didn't we come off an' leave all our household b'longin's dere? I</p>
    <p>jes' step up here to see my ma.' Wan't long after dat, ma die. An' we never</p>
    <p>did go back to Georgia. After ma die, we come to Columbia, an' ol' Silas been</p>
    <p>walkin' dese streets ever since, doin' odd jobs for plenty good white folks.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I been workin' for Mis' Reid up here on Cypress Street many a year.</p>
    <p>Dey's sho' good folks. Ef I need little money, she give it to me. Yes, ma'am,</p>
    <p>I been knowed in through here 'bout thirty-odd year. Mis' Reid say: 'Ef you</p>
    <p>want somebody to do good work, git ny nigger, old Silas, he treat you right.'</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Man ask me is I got on old age pension. I say, 'not so's I know it.'</p>
    <p>An' he say: 'Somebody ought to he'p you.' An' I say: 'Mis Reid he'p us.'</p>
    <p>Dey give her commodities for us. Mr. Reid sign de letter an' give my recom'dation. </p>
    <p>I's gonna tell you how day done. When dey sign us up, dey give one check</p>
    <p>on de house, combined us. I say I ain't got nothin', what's de use for me to</p>
    <p>cut-up? Ef Welfare didn't take care of me an' my wife, we'd be in de Po' House</p>
    <p>befo' water git hot.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"You see, it's lak dis. Mis' Reid got Welfare for ny wife, 'cause my wife</p>
    <p>she's blind. De cataracts growed over her eyes, an' now she can't see nothin',</p>
    <p>but she can do a little work in de house. White people jes' crazy 'bout my</p>
    <p>wife. All de little chillun loves me an' my wife. it jes' kill my soul when</p>
    <p>she went blind.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"My wife is a Holiness preacher. She never start preachin' 'til after she</p>
    <p>went blind. Dis comin' Sunday, she aim to preach at Joan Tabernacle, not so</p>
    <p>far from Assembly Street. She can sho' preach. Make your hair rise on your</p>
    <p>head to hear her preach. She preach one night dis weak in de bed. She was </p>
    <p>'wake, though, I thinks. Do you good to hear her. I can always tell when de</p>
    <p>spell comin' on her. She go to work an' sing an' pray. Then she give out de</p>
    <p>hymn an' tell you where her text is.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"What I'm talkin' 'bout, she ain't los' her mind. She got more sense than</p>
    <p>heap of 'em what makes a big noise an' say nothin'. What I'm talkin' 'bout, my</p>
    <p>wife's got de awfulest learnin'. She got good learnin'. My wife use to figure</p>
    <p>what we owe de storekeeper, an' what he owe us for cotton. He say he didn't</p>
    <p>want to never have no better settlement wid nobody than he always got wid us.</p>
    <p>She didn't never make no mistake. I went to school a little while, an' can</p>
    <p>read an' spell a little. But when you ain't got much, you soon lose what you</p>
    <p>got. An' now I done forgot how.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Dere was a ol' man in Edgefield County, an' what I mean I ain't tellin'</p>
    <p>you no lie; dat man couldn't read or write his own name. But I can't 'zactly</p>
    <p>call his name now. But what I means, when dat man lay down an' go to bed at</p>
    <p>night an' git to sleep, he'd preach de awfulest sermons you ever hear. Jes'</p>
    <p>lak he had plenty learnin'. He give out de number of de hymn. You look in de</p>
    <p>book, an' sho' 'nough dat was de right number. An' he give out his text an'</p>
    <p>tell you where to find it. We look in de book, an' right dere where he say, we </p>
    <p>find it. Missus, I ain't tellin' you no lie, I's heard him. It was lak dis.</p>
    <p>We'd be settin' 'round visitin' lak, an' after while we say we reckon it's time</p>
    <p>to be gittin' on back. Then we leaves an' goes down a good piece from his house</p>
    <p>an' stays 'til he git sleep an' start singin'. Then we sneaks back an' sneaks</p>
    <p>in his house, but dere wan't nothin' dat would wake him up when he start on dat</p>
    <p>mission. It was so strange lak, I'd git right nervous sometime. I figure it</p>
    <p>was jes' one of God's miracles. Dat ol' man be dead now, an' I bet his soul</p>
    <p>rest in heavenly peace.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"God, He got his eyes on all us poor folks. He know we have to go exposin'</p>
    <p>in de cold, wid nighty little rashions sometime, an' no shoes. Here I sets</p>
    <p>wid not a sock to my foot. But God say my foots is jes' as good as them what's</p>
    <p>got de cover on 'em.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I hear talk of our President comin' here to Columbia soon. I sho' do</p>
    <p>crave to see him. Dey tell me he is de onliest President of dese United States</p>
    <p>dat ever try to help de poor folks. Well, he sho' must be a good man, for he</p>
    <p>got a sight of work to do. I ain't know much 'bout politics, ain't never vote.</p>
    <p>Reckon I was too young, but I sho' see de Red Shirts a ridin' up an' down de road  </p>
    <p>when I live in Dutch Fork. Dat was when Hampton come in for governor. An'</p>
    <p>them Red Shirts sho' done a sight of ridin' an' wranglin' for Marse Hanmpton.</p>
    <p>Day tell me a heap of young bucks did vote, but I didn't never git to cast</p>
    <p>mine.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Well, Missus, I done chop you a heap of good wood, so I'll be gittin'</p>
    <p>on back to my wife. Late of a evenin' she jes' sets an' listens, and she say</p>
    <p>she can always tell when I'm 'most home. She know, too, dat I don't never go</p>
    <p>home widout I bring her a little favor. I tell her while I gone she ought to</p>
    <p>lay down an' res' her limbs, but she jes' walks 'round in de house an' tries</p>
    <p>to do 'bout a little.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I cleaned a turkey for a lady yesterday, an' she give me some of it. I</p>
    <p>told her jes' spare me 'nough for my wife an' I'd sho' be thankful. Christmas,</p>
    <p>I go 'round 'mongst my white friends wid my basket, an' dey gives me fruit,</p>
    <p>turkey, cake an' everything, 'nough to las' me an' my wife three or four weeks.</p>
    <p>I sho' got good friends.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Uncle Silas, before you go I wish you would bring a souttle of coal and</p>
    <p>an armful of wood in the kitchen for me." </p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Missus, I'll sho' be glad to. We here to he'p one 'nother."</p>
    <p/>
    <p>As he came back into the kitchen, he pulled off his hat and held it in</p>
    <p>his hands, and in a Chesterfield manner bowed and said; "Missus, I's, thankful we</p>
    <p>gittin' old, an' can change voice wid one 'nother, 'cause we don't know where</p>
    <p>death is." He slanted a look at the percolator.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"Ef you got any more coffee in dat pot, how 'bout jes' bile de grounds</p>
    <p>so's I can git het up a little befo' I starts. It's pretty cold today, an'</p>
    <p>my clothes is gittin' right airish."</p>
    <p/>
    <p>He drank his coffee in silence, and got up to take his leave: "I'll be gittin'</p>
    <p>on now, for I knows my wife lookin' for me. She make out lak she don't worry 'bout</p>
    <p>me, but, bein' blind an' can't see, she gits lonely. One day, I git home 'round</p>
    <p>dark, an' she say to me, 'Silas, don't you never be uneasy 'bout your wife.</p>
    <p>You may come in an' find me speechless an' can't speak to you, but don't worry</p>
    <p>'bout me, for you'll know I done gone on to rest. But I wants to know if you's</p>
    <p>comin' to meet me.'</p>
    <p/>
    <p>"I goes up to her an' lays my hand on her head, an' says, 'Leila May, ef</p>
    <p>de good Lord spare me, an' nothin' happen, I'll sho' meet you on de shore of</p>
    <p>Jordan.' An' de Lord knows I's speakin' de truf. But it jes' kill my soul</p>
    <p>when she went blind."            </p>
