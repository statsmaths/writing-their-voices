            <p>“The people, all the people, must be known, they must be heard,”
              proclaimed William T. Couch in 1939 from Chapel Hill. A respected
              editor turned part-time government bureaucrat, Couch served as both
              director of the University of North Carolina Press and the New Deal’s
              Federal Writers' Project (FWP) Southern Life History Project.
              As economic turmoil engulfed the nation, his concern for the voiceless
              led to the development of a new form of documentary expression called
              a “life history,” oral interviews of everyday people’s life experiences
              captured in writing by federal workers.</p>
            <p><em>Writing Their Voices: Documentary
            Evidence and the Southern Life History Project</em> recovers the history
            of the SLHP and their efforts to reconfigure the life history method. We
            employ an interdisciplinary approach that combines close readings of
            archival material with computational methods that analyze pattern across
            the collection. The digital platform gives readers an opportunity to
            explore archival materials and data alongside our argument, which opens
            up new forms of reading and interaction in the humanities. We address
            five questions: What were the motivating factors behind the creation of
            the SLHP? How did the SLHP come into formation? How did the project come
            to define the form of a life history and who was capable of writing
            them? Who was represented in the life histories and why? What are the
            legacies of the SLHP? In addressing these questions, we demonstrate key
            points in the struggle over what counted as social knowledge, how to
            accurately represent social conditions, and who could produce such
            knowledge.</p>
