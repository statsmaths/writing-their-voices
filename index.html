            <p>“The people, all the people, must be known, they must be heard,” proclaimed William T. Couch in 1939 from Chapel Hill. A respected editor turned part-time government bureaucrat, Couch served as both director of the University of North Carolina Press and the New Deal’s Federal Writers' Project (FWP) Southern Life History Project. As economic turmoil engulfed the nation, his concern for the voiceless led to the development of a new form of documentary expression called a “life history,” oral interviews of everyday people’s life experiences captured in writing by federal workers.</p>
            <p>With the support of the New Deal, Couch led a laudatory experiment in social documentary driven by a deep passion and concern for the past, present, and future of the South. Couch’s desire to circulate working-class voices grew out of his distress over how intellectuals from academia, such as acclaimed sociologist Howard Odum, and literature, such as author Erskine Caldwell, portrayed the region. While the former reduced people to nameless statistics, the latter depicted the region as backwards, a theme federal bureaucrats drew on to argue that the region could not modernize and move out of the Great Depression.</p>
